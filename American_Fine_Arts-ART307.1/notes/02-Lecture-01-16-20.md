## Homework

### John Copley

### Charles Wilson Peale

### Benjamin West (p. 136-138)

## Notes

- the beginnings were very humble
- people only wanted to have portraits as they were merchants
- Copley and Peale were genuine American painters
- _we chose Renaissance portraits that we liked and posted them on e-course,
explaining what we like about them [here][1]_
- these portraits show very different things -- seeking, self-assuredness,
energy, determination, authority, power
- G. Hesselius portraits show that he had sympathy for the Natives
- in his letter though, he didn't think much of them, he found Colonial America
appalling
- "_it is a savage and terrifying folk. They are naked ..._" writes Hesselius
in a letter sent from Colonial America
- it took him 20 years of living in America between writing this letter and pain    ting the Native chiefs
- he became an anthropologist and then painted the Natives from that kind of
perspective
- Hesselius describes the environment that he was presented with when he came
to America, a mess of competing religions, ethnicities, just a total mess
- John Copley -- generally self taught artist, mostly learned from looking at
copies and reproductions of other paintings
- he mostly painted rich Americans, he showed class, wealth, and dignity, not
necessarily beauty
- he had great skills when it comes to the technical aspects, like painting
reflections on an expensive hardwood table
- his self portrait might show a certain insecurity, as if he is searching for
something, he was not completely happy -- portraits did not feel fulfilling for
him
- America was not a place for him to show his full potential, but in America
there was no demand for anything that was not a portrait
- when the Independence War started, he got involved because his father-in-law
was the loyalist merchant whose tea was thrown into the harbor during the
Boston Tea Party
- in Great Britain he could paint pictures that would never find buyers in
America because the interest in art is very different there
- his talent is recognized in GB and starts to paint historical paintings,
which were not marketable in America
- as an American living in London he paints British history for the local
audience, not American history, of which there was not a lot at that point
