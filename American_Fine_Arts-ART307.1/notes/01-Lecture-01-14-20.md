## Intro

- map of the colonial US shows that most of the land was claimed by France and
Spain and not the US initially (1776)
- there was no/almost not art in the original 13 Colonies

## Art in Colonial America

- merchants had the leading role, educated themselves and the like
- colonists were well read in general, also read popular literature
- in the spirit of enlightenment public libraries were created and many
universities founded
- the driving force of those original 13 Colonies were the merchants
- there was nothing in the colonies themselves, so someone had to bring the
products into the country -- this gave them their power
- at the beginning the merchants were the only ones buying art -- they only
wanted portraits of themselves to represent themselves
- America did not have any artists, so they imported ones from the old world --
they did not get the best artists
- _John Smibert - The Bermuda Group_ is a good painting, but it lacks character
and identity, all the characters looks the same
- Smibert was the one to open the first museum in America, in Boston
- he introduced that art and also sold art supplies etc.
- _Gustavus Hesselius - Lapowinska_ is a painting of a Native American Chief
(Delaware Tribe) which is unusual for the time
- they were also portrayed with emotions and real faces, showing how tired they
were 
- this particular chief is the one that sold Pennsylvania, he looks tired
