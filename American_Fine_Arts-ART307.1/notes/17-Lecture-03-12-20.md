## Notes 

- Hopper: linearity, closed-off, solitary in a way
- painted women alone, looking out of windows sometimes -- one of his favorite
subjects
- _loneliness of people together_
- _Thomas Benton_ painted murals for an international exhibition in the U.S. --
he painted for the state of Indiana
- after the exhibition the president of Indiana University got the murals for
the university
- one of them shows the KKK at a rally -- recently, students wanted it removed 
because it violated their right to not be discriminated against
- it was ultimately not removed because history is not pretty and Benton was
critical of them and references an investigation that seriously hurt them 
- _Grant Wood_ American Gothic shows a farmer and his daughter standing in
front of their house
- Wood painted this picture when the house inspired and he wanted to paint "the
kind of people I fancied should live in that house"
- the picture is a depiction of simplicity in the people, their lifestyle,
house and so on
- it's clean, simple, well taken care of, but also judgemental as all hell
- that's rural America

## Cubism

- _Max Weber_ Rush Hour, New York -- a cubist and abstract painting that really
keeps with the spirit of geometric shapes and lines in art that somewhat define
cubism
- the painting is also part of futurism -- interested in showing the dynamics
and wonders of modern technology and new life -- this meant that new methods
were needed to show the new dynamic ways people lived like
- Rush Hour captures the spirit of a rush hour pretty well, even though it does
not depict them in a super understandable way
- influenced by Picasso, e.g. Picasso's three woman inspired Weber's three
figures
