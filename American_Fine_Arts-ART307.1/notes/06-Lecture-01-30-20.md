## Homework

### Romanticism

- American landscape was something new and somethings that set them apart from
Europe
- the US had a ton of land and gave it away cheaply
- there were many trails established that connected the new lands to the east
- manifest destiny was coined and people generally accepted it as right
- together with reminiscence about how the land in the east used to look people
began romanticizing nature
- after 1825 Americans wanted pictures of the land itself because of that
- rich folks often wanted to have pictures that posed a contrast to the cities
and business that they were involved in and armchair travellers could enjoy
themselves

### Thomas Cole

- 1801-1848
- called the founder of American landscape painting even though he was not the
first
- some of his predecessors were painting too idyllic pictures that people did
not like as they did not represent the America they knew anymore
- Cole was the first artist whose representations really struck a chord
- he grew up in England amidst the Industrial Revolution -- many aspects of his
art and life seem to be influenced by that
- 1818: he came to the US with his parents, was amazed by the scenery, 1825 
visited Catskill Mountains
- Cole was selftaught, created his own version of landscape painting
- the pristine wilderness appealed to Americans, provided a sanctuary
- _Associationism:_ getting to know God by appreciating his natural works
- a Romantic spirit would also find joy in Cole's pictures of forests, cliffs
and storms
- American antiques were gnarled old treetrunks, while the European trunks were
man-made -- a sawed-off treetrunk was a symbol for this wilderness coming to an
end
- he believed that history painting was the highest form of art, while
landscape painting was low -- it had to be ennobled
- he used legends, historical events or literary pieces for that, for example
_Last of the Mohicans_
- 1829: he went to Europe to improve his art -- he was moved by ruins that
showed him human ambition, pride, and folly

#### The Course of Empire

- return to NYC in 1832, began a 5 picture series called _The Course of Empire_
- stages: 
    - _Savage:_ too wild and chaotic
    - _Pastoral:_ men, women, children living in harmony with nature
    - _Consummation of the Empire:_ hedonism, destruction of the works of God
    (nature), religious ceremonies
    - _Destruction of the Empire:_ destruction of the architecture, slaughter,
    burning, pillage
    - _Desolation:_ ruins of the city in the moonlight, nature reclaims the
    scene (God triumphs)
- Cole believed that America was on a similar course
- these paintings were not so popular, patrons preferred the "real" America

#### The Voyage of Life

- next series of 4 paintings -- hero travels on the river of life, pictures
show elements of fate and time
- stages:
    - _Infancy:_ guardian angel watches over the boy from the barge
    - _Youth:_ angel now watches from riverbank, because the young boy wants to
    be in charge and pursue the castles in the sky
    - _Manhood_
    - _Old Age_
- this symbolism was easier to understand and Americans loved it
- prints of _Youth_ in particular became very popular, was often interpreted
as discovering the American future and Manifest Destiny

#### The Architect's Dream

- visual fantasy and love for different historical architectural styles
- commissioned by Ithiel Town, who is in it and has some of his books strewn
around him
- it shows all the great building styles of the past before the architects eyes

### Alfred Bierstadt

- 1830-1902
- brought to America as an infant, returned to Duesseldorf to study at the
Rhineland art center
- spent a year in Italy, established a studio in NYC
- 1859: trip to the American West (Rocky Mountains) with army expedition
- on horseback, in perilous circumstances -- Bierstadt made countless
oil sketches of natives, animals, and the scenery
- this mostly -- to white people -- unknown scenery became the basis of his art
and reputation
- 1863: paints his most famous picture _The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak_
- it was a huge canvas 3 meters across and showed a majestic mountain landscape
- he was also praised for his anthropological description of natives
- 1863: next trip to the west, to California and the Pacific Northwest
- many canvases, notably _Yosemite Valley_ and the _Sierra Nevada Mountains_
- particular picture: _Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California_ shows the
massive scale by placing small natives, bears, deer in the picture
- _Emigrants Crossing the Plains_ shows wagon trains going by native
encampments -- inhospitable, pristine, hope, ultimate success
