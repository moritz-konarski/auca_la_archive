Conceptual Art
--------------

<https://www.theartstory.org/movement/conceptual-art/>

-   ideas are prized over formal or visual components of art works
-   mix of tendencies and not super cohesive
-   mid 60s to mid 70s they completely rejected standard ideas of art
-   articulation of an idea suffices as a work of art
-   it was weird to people at first, but like abstract expressionism it
    expanded what art was
-   they abandoned beauty, rarity, skill as measures of art
-   influenced by Minimalism, readymades
-   deeply indebted and based on readymades by Marcel Duchamp --
    idea-based art
-   Fluxus (inspiration by everyday things and embrace of change) and
    Minimalism (non-traditional size, materials, production) inspired it
-   defiance of the art market where personalities and masterpieces were
    being promoted
-   1967 saw the "manifesto" by Sol LeWitt: *What the work of art looks
    like isn't too important. It has to look like something if it has
    physical form. No matter what form it may finally have it must begin
    with an idea. It is the process of conception and realization with
    which the artist is concerned.*
-   this went against what art was defined as at the time
-   some took it so far that they didn't produce physical art at all and
    just left it at the ideas stage
-   a good bit of this art was political in nature: commenting on the
    pharmaceutical industry and AIDS epidemic, political oppression
-   conceptualism can have a variety of different forms
-   Lawrence Weiner in "Declaration of Intent": *Art that imposes
    conditions - human or otherwise - on the receiver for its
    appreciation in my eyes constitutes aesthetic fascism*

Postmodernism
-------------

<https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postmodernism>

-   reaction against modernism and its dominance
-   associated with skepticism, irony, critique of universal truths and
    objective reality
-   first used in 1970
-   it is hard to define because it does not follow some kind of theory
-   modernism was based on idealism and utopian visions on human life --
    universal principles and truths (religion, science) could ultimately
    explain reality
-   thus post-modernism was based in skepticism, suspicion of reason;
    challenged the idea of universal truths -- individual experience is
    more concrete than abstract principles
-   **postmodernism often embraced complex and contradictory layers of
    meaning**
-   anti-authoritarian, it refused a single style or definition
-   it broke barriers between high culture and everyday culture,
    introduced a sense of anything goes
-   it consciously borrows from different styles and styles from the
    past and comments on that too

Feminist Art
------------

<https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/168>

-   art which seeks to challenge the dominance of men in art and society
-   gain recognition, equality for woman artists, question assumptions
    about womanhood
-   beginning in the 1960s painting, performance art, and "women's
    crafts" were made that aimed to end sexism and oppression
-   exposed femininity as masquerade -- set of poses women adopt to
    conform to society
-   younger artists also incorporate intersecting concerns about race,
    class, forms of privilege, gender identity and fluidity
-   this art style continues to evolve

<https://www.theartstory.org/movement/feminist-art/>

-   emerged in the 1960s amidst general civil rights, anti-war, and
    queer rights movements
-   wanted to re-write falsely male-dominated art history
-   also wanted to intervene in current culture and transform
    stereotypes
-   created previously non-existent opportunities for women and minority
    artists
-   paved the way for identity art of the 1980s
-   wanted dialogue through inclusion of womens perspective
-   art is not just for aesthetics, but also to incite, to bring change
    towards equality
-   creation of alternate venues for women in the arts made exhibitions
    in a prohibitive environment possible
-   also worked to change existing policies to promote women
-   often used "female materials" like textiles or previously seldom
    used media like performance and video -- lacked male-dominated
    history and expanded the definition of fine art

Photomontage
------------

<https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/photomontage>

-   collage constructed from photographs
-   often used to express poltical dissent
-   first used by dadaists in 1915 in protest against WWI
-   then used by surrealists to do their thing

<https://www.theartstory.org/definition/photomontage/history-and-concepts/>

-   was controversial at first because it misrepresented reality but
    people wanted to create things that rivaled fine art

Quotes

-   Direct address has been a consistent tactic in my work, regardless
    of the medium that I'm working in.
-   I try to deal with the complexities of power and social life, but as
    far as the visual presentation goes I purposely avoid a high degree
    of difficulty. I want people to be drawn into the work.
-   Do you know why language manifests itself the way it does in my
    work? It's because I understand short attention spans.
-   I basically wasn't cut out for design work because I had difficulty
    in supplying someone else's image of perfection
-   I think that art is still a site for resistance ... I'm trying to be
    affective, to suggest changes, and to resist what I feel are the
    tyrannies of social life on a certain level.
