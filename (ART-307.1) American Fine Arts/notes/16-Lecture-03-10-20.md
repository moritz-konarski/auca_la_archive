- America in the 20th centuries -- U.S. becomes a superpower and American art
becomes something of its own

## Realism

- Ashcan school: name comes from smoking -- ashcan == ashtray
- ashtrays smell like hell and smoking was very popular -- the artists painted
them and _The Masses_ made a comment that it was too much, the artists liked it
and the name stuck around
- the artists wanted to see the daily life and the city of the poor and working
class people -- generally in New York
- _Cliff Dwellers_ by George Bellows shows city streets in working class
neighborhoods, high-rise houses are likened to cliffs in nature
- _The wake of ferry II_ by John Sloan shows a man standing alone at the back
of a ferry in New York -- shows loneliness and everyday life in the city
- _Both memebers of the club_ by George Bellows is titled thusly because public
boxing was prohibited and "the club" was used as an excuse to claim that both
contestants were members of he club and could thus box
- Hopper painted solitude and isolated moments, with lots of suggestion
