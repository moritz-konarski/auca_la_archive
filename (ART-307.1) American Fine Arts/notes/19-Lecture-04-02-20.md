## Which art does capitalism favor: social realism or abstract expressionism?

### Social Realism

class
- critiques the power structures behind those conditions
- reveal tensions between an oppressive, hegemonic force and its victims
- expose deteriorating conditions of the working class
- hold governments and social systems accountable
- 1930s, Great Depression Era

### Abstract Expressionism

- developed in New York in 1940s
- movement has image of rebellious, anarchic, nihilistic
- after WWII Social Realism was not acceptable
- response to artistic censorship at that time -- McCarthy era
- abstract enough to be acceptable, not abstract enough to be apolitical
