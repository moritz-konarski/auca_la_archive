## Organizational

- some checks for webex
- learning about video call etiquette
- send him an email requesting the midterm results
- we will have a digital final exam that is open book too
- we also have to do the presentations -- they will be online in writing
- word count: we have some margins around 900 words, maybe a little bit more -- 
think of some way to add text to presentations effectively
- guidelines should include at least 3 different artists too, so not just stuff
from a single artist
- we may also choose a thing, e.g. an apple, New York, American cities, and 
find pictures related to that -- if we choose our own criteria we have to 
explain then
- the second option is recommended for juniors and seniors: how can one use art
connected to their major or even in a thesis defense
- American artists of the period we are talking about started out with European
influences but got rid of them over time
