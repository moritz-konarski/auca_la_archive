  abstract = {The British Association for Holocaust Studies presents a lecture evening with Professor James E. Young - The Stages of Memory: Reflections on Memorialisation and Global Commemoration hosted by Hannah Wilson and Elizabeth Kendrick. James E. Young is Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of English and Judaic \&amp; Near Eastern Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he is Founding Director of the Institute for Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies. Professor Young has paved the way for debates surrounding Holocaust memorials, commemoration, and creative responses, with his ground- breaking publications The Texture of Memory (1993), At Memory's Edge (2000) and The Stages of Memory (2016). In this slide-lecture, Professor Young will trace what he calls ``the memorial's arc'' from Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, to German Holocaust memorials, to the National September 11 Memorial in New York City. Professor Young served on the design juries for both Berlin's Memorial for Europe's Murdered Jews and for the 9/11 Memorial competition and will discuss these processes from his perspective as a juror.}

  abstract = {The White Rose (German: Wei\ss e Rose, pronounced [{$\Elzverts$}va{\textsubarch ɪ}s{$\Elzschwa$} {$\Elzverts$}ʁo{$\Elzlmrk$}z{$\Elzschwa$}] (listen)) was a non-violent, intellectual resistance group in Nazi Germany led by a group of students from the University of Munich, including Sophie Scholl, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell. The group conducted an anonymous leaflet and graffiti campaign that called for active opposition to the Nazi regime. Their activities started in Munich on 27 June 1942, and ended with the arrest of the core group by the Gestapo on 18 February 1943. They, as well as other members and supporters of the group who carried on distributing the pamphlets, faced show trials by the Nazi People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), and many of them were sentenced to death or imprisonment. Hans and Sophie Scholl, as well as Christoph Probst were executed by guillotine four days after their arrest, on 22 February 1943. During the trial, Sophie interrupted the judge multiple times. No defendants were given any opportunity to speak. The group wrote, printed and initially distributed their pamphlets in the greater Munich region. Later on, secret carriers brought copies to other cities, mostly in the southern parts of Germany. In total, the White Rose authored six leaflets, which were multiplied and spread, in a total of about 15,000 copies. They denounced the Nazi regime's crimes and oppression, and called for resistance. In their second leaflet, they openly denounced the persecution and mass murder of the Jews. By the time of their arrest, the members of the White Rose were just about to establish contacts with other German resistance groups like the Kreisau Circle or the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group of the Red Orchestra. Today, the White Rose is well known both within Germany and worldwide.},
