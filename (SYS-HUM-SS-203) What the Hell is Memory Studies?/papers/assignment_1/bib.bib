Young is Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of English and Judaic \&amp; Near Eastern Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he is Founding Director of the Institute for Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies. Professor Young has paved the way for debates surrounding Holocaust memorials, commemoration, and creative responses, with his ground- breaking publications The Texture of Memory (1993), At Memory's Edge (2000) and The Stages of Memory (2016). In this slide-lecture, Professor Young will trace what he calls ``the memorial's arc'' from Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, to German Holocaust memorials, to the National September 11 Memorial in New York City. Professor Young served on the design juries for both Berlin's Memorial for Europe's Murdered Jews and for the 9/11 Memorial competition and will discuss these processes from his perspective as a juror.}

  abstract = {South Africa's truth and reconciliation process is perhaps the best-known example of an institutionalized attempt to build a more democratic future by confronting human rights atrocities from the past. Yet the South African case is often quite misunderstood, with many misconceptions widely accepted and asserted. This article addresses five facts about the South African experience. Using data from a large national survey of ordinary people, it demonstrates both that the truth and reconciliation process is viewed as effective by most people and that in fact systematic evidence indicates that the process achieved several of its primary goals. From the South African case we learn that, despite their various shortcomings and compromises, truth processes can attain legitimacy among ordinary people in transitional systems and that they can contribute to societal reconciliation. /// Le processus de v\'erit\'e et reconciliation d'Afrique du Sud est peut-\^etre l'exemple le plus connu d'une tentative institutionalis\'ee d'\'etablir un futur plus d\'emocratique en se confrontant aux atrocit\'es du pass\'e dans le domaine des droits de rhomme. Pourtant, le cas sud-africain est souvent mal compris, v\'ehiculant nombre d'id\'ees fausses largement admises et affirm\'ees. Cet article pr\'esente cinq faits sur l'exp\'erience sud-africaine. Utilisant les donn\'ees d'une grande enqu\^ete nationale aupr\`es de la population, je d\'emontre \`a la fois que le processus de v\'erit\'e et r\'econciliation est regard\'e comme efficace par la plupart des personnes et qu'en fait, l'epreuve syst\'ematique indique que le processus a atteint plusieurs de ses buts primaires. Du cas sud-africain, nous apprenons que, en d\'epit de leurs divers imperfections et compro-mis, les processus de v\'erit\'e peuvent obtenir la l\'egitimit\'e aupr\`es des gens ordinaires dans les syst\`emes de transition et qu'ils peuvent contribuer \`a la reconciliation sociale.},

But are "truth" and "reconciliation" concepts that can be measured rigorously and reliability? I present evidence in this article that each can be measured as an attribute of individuals, based on a large survey conducted in South Africa. My findings indicate that truth does indeed contribute to reconciliation. But because reconciliation is quite capable of changing (and likely to change) over time, efforts must be made to track levels of reconciliation as an important social indicator. Many countries in transition would profit greatly from implementing a Reconciliation Barometer to measure movement toward or away from the consolidation of democratic reform.},

It examines whether the participants of each ethnic group viewed the TRC to be effective in bringing out the truth and bringing about reconciliation. The article also examines whether the TRC was viewed as having had a positive effect on South Africa's society, economy, politics, and image in the world. In addition, the perceived overall success of the TRC is assessed. The Afrikaner participants perceived the TRC to be less effective than the English participants and much less effective than the Xhosa participants. Finally, the article discusses potential future benefits that may be gained from the experiences of South Africa's TRC to manage ethnic and racial conflicts in other parts of the world.},

  abstract = {The emergence of restorative justice as an alternative model to Western, court-based criminal justice may have important implications for the psychology of justice. It is proposed that two different notions of justice affect responses to rule-breaking: restorative and retributive justice. Retributive justice essentially refers to the repair of justice through unilateral imposition of punishment, whereas restorative justice means the repair of justice through reaffirming a shared value-consensus in a bilateral process. Among the symbolic implications of transgressions, concerns about status and power are primarily related to retributive justice and concerns about shared values are primarily related to restorative justice. At the core of these processes, however, lies the parties' construal of their identity relation, specifically whether or not respondents perceive to share an identity with the offender. The specific case of intergroup transgressions is discussed, as are implications for future research on restoring a sense of justice after rule-breaking.},

  abstract = {The White Rose (German: Wei\ss e Rose, pronounced [{$\Elzverts$}va{\textsubarch ɪ}s{$\Elzschwa$} {$\Elzverts$}ʁo{$\Elzlmrk$}z{$\Elzschwa$}] (listen)) was a non-violent, intellectual resistance group in Nazi Germany led by a group of students from the University of Munich, including Sophie Scholl, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell. The group conducted an anonymous leaflet and graffiti campaign that called for active opposition to the Nazi regime. Their activities started in Munich on 27 June 1942, and ended with the arrest of the core group by the Gestapo on 18 February 1943. They, as well as other members and supporters of the group who carried on distributing the pamphlets, faced show trials by the Nazi People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), and many of them were sentenced to death or imprisonment. Hans and Sophie Scholl, as well as Christoph Probst were executed by guillotine four days after their arrest, on 22 February 1943. During the trial, Sophie interrupted the judge multiple times. No defendants were given any opportunity to speak. The group wrote, printed and initially distributed their pamphlets in the greater Munich region. Later on, secret carriers brought copies to other cities, mostly in the southern parts of Germany. In total, the White Rose authored six leaflets, which were multiplied and spread, in a total of about 15,000 copies. They denounced the Nazi regime's crimes and oppression, and called for resistance. In their second leaflet, they openly denounced the persecution and mass murder of the Jews. By the time of their arrest, the members of the White Rose were just about to establish contacts with other German resistance groups like the Kreisau Circle or the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group of the Red Orchestra. Today, the White Rose is well known both within Germany and worldwide.},
