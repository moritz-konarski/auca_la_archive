# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Living in a Post-Traditional Society (Anthony Giddens)

p. 430

- british sociologist, main dude in reflexive modernization
- place of tradition and detraditionalization in this framework
- warns against repressiveness of traditionalism
- traditions are there, even in modernized societies; sometimes they even
thrive
- there are two frameworks for traditions in modern societies
- traditions can defended in a variety of ways, but it needs to be open to
dialogue and not just threaten violence
- if this is not true, traditions turns into fundamentalism
- fundamentalism can only assume forms against radical doubt
- fundamentalism: assertion of truth without regard for any consequences
- destruction of the local community reached its apogee in developed countries
- little traditions have mostly disappeared; distinction between great and
little traditions has basically disappeared
- high and low culture are still a thing, but they play less of a role
- the things local culture references becomes increasingly more remote; the
meaning of local customs changes as they become relics or habits
- habits are personal forms of routinization; people attach significance to
them and they give them structure
- customs are more general and created by some common influence, but if they
stem from traditional practices, they are maybe neurotic remnants--you just do
it because you have to and not because there is any sense in it
- artefacts simply become relics, but are still full of meaning of a transcended
past
- relics belong to a past that has no development, they are not really
connected to anything around them
- relics are only significant because of the past that they belong to
- modernity does not mean disappearance of collective ritual, generally it is
a recent invention
- formulaic truth -- mystical notions
- ritualism is displaced by ritualization
- tradition continues to exist wherever mystical notions can help interpret the
past
- creation of monuments can foster the creation of a new nationalism
- tradition is not just about celebrating the past, it is also about changing
the future by taking it as a resource

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Lost Time: On Remembering and Forgetting in Late Modern Culture (David Gross)

p. 434

- things can be out of historical sync with the present
- noncontemporaneity: absolute, relative, enduring
- reference to the past is not always regressive
- forgetting a collective past can free one from burden
- forgetting can be a good thing; fresh perspective, better engagement with
the world
- can also make the future more clear, opportunities more apparent, future is
in the long run more important than the past
- that's why forgetting is very popular right now
- what can be gained from collective remembering?
- collective memory gives greater breadth of awareness, can enrich and
stimulate
- it can also provide a better standpoint to judge our current situation
- we can do these by looking at what is not in ruling memory schema
- noncontemporaneous, kind of the "forgotten" of current memory
- discordant with the present because it is from another time
- memory of the noncontemporaneous carries potential for creativity and
critique
- modernity created the distinctions between contemporary and noncontemporary
elements a lot sharper than they had ever existed before; what is "modern" or
"unmodern"
- the more modern stuff replaces older stuff, the more noncontemporaneous stuff
gets produced; not all noncontemp things are the same
- absolute nctmp: past is obliterated except for a few things in museums; can
only be abstractly reconstructed (history, archeology)
- relative nctmp: left some noticeable traces behind, even though it has passed
- e.g. cosmology, stuff from before industrialization, old honor codes
- they are broken pieces of a whole that has disappeared
- should not be used as traditions because they are disconnected from
surroundings
- these are useful because they can lead back to the whole that existed in the
past
- enduring nctmp: survived intact into the present age; continuing/ living
presence of the past; "unzeitgem&auml;ssig"
- to survive they must retreat from the main stream
- they preserve living nodes of nctmp, carry it on
- remembering these nctmp things will give us a richer idea of the past than if
we forgot stuff
- this also gives information about what people are forgetting at the moment
- true value of vanishing can only be appreciated if one is aware of
fleetingness

# _Class_ 28.04.2021

- Meerim presentation, text about the IBM programmers
- presentation didn't bring anything interesting 
- skewing of "survival of the fittest" to serve the purposes of capitalism
- what do individualism and memory have to do with each other
    - memory here turns into something private that people have to protect from
    others
    - where communities share their memories, they draw closer together, get
    a sense of solidarity, even if the memory itself is traumatic
    - collective memory is a source of social strength
    - solidarity is a significant idea in memory and stuff
    - "Truthful memory opens wounds which forgetting cannot heal; the traces of 
    conflict, failure and disaster are never erasable in time."
        - e.g. crimes against entire peoples, etc
- Zarena's presentation on Jeffrey Alexander's text
    - cultural trauma: terrifying event that leaves marks on collective
    consciousness
    - trauma can be a source of solidarity, also for perpetrators or
    bystanders
    - groups can also ignore other peoples' trauma, thus excluding groups from
    solidarity
    - trauma does not need to be violent, just a quick change that leaves its
    marks
    - trauma shatters our horizon of expectations
    - personal trauma tends to be sudden; trauma for groups is a process, it
    develops over time
    - trauma is a construction and events cannot be inherently traumatic
    - why do these people have to just stupidly read the text back to us?
    - it's so fucking dumb and boring
    - media also plays an important role in creating these traumas
    - issue of media, even if it is not modern media, and its influence on what
    is going on
- having privatized issues will prevent common memory and trauma
- Abrahamitic religions built on the trauma of the exodus, maybe Moseic
religions
- in Sennett, "[B]y sharing rather than privatizing memories, communities might 
find a way to tell the truth about themselves. The question is, how?"
- sharing memory globally (in cosmopolitan model)
- pluralism of voices is better, has a better chance to weed out the bullshit
- accuracy of memory should be increased by more voices? It adds information,
but that does not necessary mean the truth is known by the majority
