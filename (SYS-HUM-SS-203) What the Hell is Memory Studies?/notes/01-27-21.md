## Free writing

Why should the Democrats try Trump, even if they will fail?

One reason for trying Trump is that it could be a good political move. The
Democrats have been wanting to impeach him for a long time. Finally doing this
could give them a popularity boost with their followers who want to see that.
Additionally, if they really want to put a mark on Trump's legacy, impeaching
him would do that. They could finally say that their accusations amounted to
something. Up until now they have never actually made anything of all their
accusations, but if he were to be impeached they could finally say they did
something.

Furthermore, they would be holding Trump accountable. This is simply a matter
of believing that if injustice was done, it must be rectified or at least
sanctioned in some way. Relating to our reading, this "criminal past" needs to
reckoned with so that they can move on. If this trial were successful, it would
also establish the accusations as fact (at least a bit). This would again give
credibility to the people that have accused Trump for years. 

Assuming that they will fail does not change the fact that they are trying to
make history reflect what they think is right. In a way, this trial is
negotiating Trump's legacy. Not trying him and just accepting defeat would look
a lot weaker than trying and failing. Accepting defeat would signal that they
do not believe in their own cause. If they try Trump and fail, they can still
say that they tried and only failed because of partisan politics. This might
even further their cause in a way, cementing their base through a shared
defeat. Trying to impeach Trump in the knowledge that they will fail sends a
signal saying "We tried, and we do not agree with what he did". Also, putting
the second impeachment on Trump's record marks him regardless of the outcome of
the trial. Also, if he is impeached he is stripped of certain privileges that
ex-Presidents have, so it would even hurt him a little bit personally.

## _Galina_ Memory in Post-Authoritarian Societies (Andreas Langenohl)

- how Trump's situation is
- parallel to Putin's Russia in how the authoritarianism works
- people respecting Putin: people fear Russia, he is smart\dots
- what does Putin know that Biden does not?
    - he knows how to hold on to power, that is certain
    - Putin is shown as savior in other countries
- there is still discussion about WWII and how to remember it. How did you
react to the events of 2020 leading up to the 75th anniversary? USA
misrepresented the facts of what happened/the Soviet role being downplayed.
    - in Canada he didn't learn anything about what the SU contributed to WWII
    - the only WW related holiday is Remembrance Day/Armistice Day in Canada
- why are our memories structured a certain way around certain events
- most big Soviet statues are still here in Bishkek. That is not something that
you see in other former SU countries. Should they (not) be torn down?

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Social Forgetting: A Systems-Theory Approach (Elena Esposito)

p. 181

## 

- forgetting accompanies memory and shows its darker sides
- to remember we need to forget all the irrelevant things to free up space
- Themistocles was more interested in lethotechnics (forgetting) than
mnemotechnics (remembering)
- Nietzsche wrote on forgetting and how it can free you in a way
- forgetting is a thorny matter: a technique to forget is a paradox---something
that denies itself
- many strategies over time have been of that nature, some amassing memories to
neutralize others
- _ars memoriae_ generally implied some _ars oblivionalis_
- writing was sometimes seen as fostering forgetting and not
remembering---freeing the mind of irrelevant and troublesome memories
- forgetting is always reflexive---who intends to forget needs to confront his
own memory construction, who just remembers can fool themselves into thinking
they only record data
- "In remembering, one faces the world; in forgetting one faces oneself---a
circumstance that will always create problems for all approaches that believe
the two references to be independent."

##

- systems theory does not include the view point _from the outside_, the
observation includes itself
- this approach lends itself to studying forgetting
- the main function of memory lies in forgetting, not to clog up memory and
become unusable---it keeps itself open for new stimuli
- most stuff is forgotten, and only stuff relevant to build identity is
retained
- remembering and forgetting always proceed together---if one could not
remember there is nothing to forget, and without forgetting remembering would
be quickly overloaded
- most things are forgotten and only some things are remembered
- both abilities need to increase or decrease at the same time
- an equilibrium is needed to keep the system operational and not arbitrary
- forgetting has priority because it is unnoticed: you have to forget the
remembering/forgetting

##

- systems theory has a different approach to memory than other sociological
disciplines
- it does not focus on shared memory as we have talked about
- instead, the seat of collective memory is the consciousness of the
individuals---this differs from social memory
- the more complex society is, the more limited collective memory becomes
- social memory emerges based on social operations
- I think this means at first there was a personal connection in a way, which
became weaker with weakening collective ties, then societal memory took over,
shaped by societal processes (more complex)

## 

- _ars memoriae_ has been a great tool over time and worth studying, but the
printing press made it clear that they are not necessary
- memory does not accumulate memory like a store house in this system view, 
- "Memory, in this view, does not serve to accumulate fixed memories as a sort
of storehouse that would be more efficient the more materials it can include,
but serves rather to eliminate the punctual aspects of the events in an ever
more refined process of abstraction" (p. 184)
- memory is not supposed to preserve the events, but allow addition to already
known categories of memory and forget all else
- memory serves to create independence from time
- it is not a storage system, but a computing device that has procedures to
re-generate data and not the original data
- "Memory does not record the past, which would be of no use and would only be
an overload, but reconstructs it every time for a future projected in ever new
ways."
- remembrance never creates the same answer twice

##

- task of memory lies in organizing information access
- "Thanks to its memory, the system has a past from which to depart in turning
to what is to come—in a more or less open way" (p. 185)
- this the observers world depends their capability to understand and 
capability (its memory)
- memory performs a constant test of consistency
- memory influences the world of a system
- it reflects most of all the relationship of the system with itself
- "And that is why forgetting becomes the primary function: It is the ability 
to select which produces each time the identity of the system as distinct from 
its environment." (p. 186)

## 

- how does this work when considering societies
- this memory cannot be in the minds of the people or in society as a whole
- thoughts are preceded by linguistic forms
- words correspond to concepts and categories, they allow objects to be
recalled for long periods of time
- the social ability to remember and forget must be passed to the media
- written communication must be less specific because its contents must be
understood by all involved in the communication
- "Whoever writes for the printing press does not address specific partners, 
and gives up the control of the situation. One does not know who will read the 
text, in what context or with what interests, and the text thus exposes itself 
to the production of meaning guided by entirely unpredictable references (the 
famous plurality of interpretations, where every reader can make of a text what 
he or she wants, producing a sense different from that of other readers and 
possibly also from the sense the author intended)." (p. 187)
- communication now works on the grounds that the information needed for
understanding is available _somewhere_, vs being known to the reader when its
written
- we have fewer things memorized but have access to a wider array of
information
- we can thus forget and lose contexts because they are available if we need
- printing strengthens and also overloads memory---it helps us both remember
and forget

##

- mass media a now supposed to construct an image of reality for the whole
system
- social systems are constituted by communication, objects of memory are topics
one can talk about and expect other people to know
- these are mostly offered by mass media, just personal experience is not
enough
- societal memory is thus ruled by mass media and the search for novelty
- this type of memory is also truly independent from personal experiences
- mass media only offers the themes and not the opinions about them 
- "But we can communicate with almost everyone, without any need to know them 
or to be in the same place, sharing very little in common, but remembering more 
or less the same things and forgetting immediately almost everything."
