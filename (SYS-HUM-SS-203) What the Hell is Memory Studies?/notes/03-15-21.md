- revolution shapes memory
- Rakhiliya's presentation

## _Rakhilya_ Claude Levi-Strauss

- French anthropologist
- created structural anthropology
- idea: every society started from the same fundamentals and later separated
- every culture has the same fundamental roots
- rooted in linguistics
- "Savage Mind" meant untrained by society, not in the usual sense
- he talks about recurring historical sequences (seasons, exchange of goods and
services)
- some people accept it, some deny it
- strict rules needed to prevent conflicts
- he talks about Australian tribes
- mourning rites turn the present into the past
- the past survives in books and archives; how do events survive in the present
- what is the meaning and where does it come from?
- spirituality and materialism are strongly related to this
- post-colonialism meant looking at the terms people used and what assumptions
they had that turned out not to hold true
- hierarchical relationships might be problematic
- problematic assumptions need to be checked; using the word savage is
a problem that he needed to address
- reversible time?
- ancestors become spirits and whatever
- diachronic and anachronism (not timely, e.g. a medieval town in current
times)
- something remains the same or changes, but it is preserved within time
- this somehow means that the memories narrate a story about the past
- commemorations bring the past to the present
