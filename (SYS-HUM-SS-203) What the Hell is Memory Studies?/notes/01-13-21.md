# _Notes_ A Hidden Life (2019)

- about a conscientious objector from Austria in WWII
- main character is called Franz J&auml;gerst&auml;tter
- he is simply a farmer that sticks to his guns (or far away from them)
- he is Catholic, didn't serve in the German army, didn't swear fealty to
Hitler, or respond to "Heil Hitler!" salutes
- as a result he was attacked in different ways in an attempt to break him
- in the end he is executed for his refusal and disobedience
- lives in St. Radegrund with wife Franziska (Fani), living on farm work
- he is drafted in '39 but does not see combat
- next time in '43, Germany has conquered many countries, killed millions,
started the Holocaust, and Franz simply cannot serve in that war
- it is complex in the interplay with his marriage: he became political and
principled after marrying Fani, but now she wants him to give in because
otherwise she will be without husband
- Can one stick to his guns if it makes one's family suffer? Is it a sin to act
in self-preservation? Where does one draw the line?
- some people feel guilty because Franz is willing to suffer for his beliefs
- he finds supporters in many places, but none willing to stick up for him or
to stand up to the Nazis
- some Nazis even get introspection, like the judge that questions Franz and
then seems to put himself into Franz's shoes
- integrates these struggles into normal life
- Waldlan is a soldier who becomes a conscientious objector because of Franz
- regular citizens identify with government bullies of course
- soldiers (many really young) abuse Franz, tie him up, scream at him, all like
bullies who know that their victims cannot fight back
- one coverd phenomenon is that regular people invest their self-worth, pride,
fantasy of machismo into a single authoritarian figure---this might be
a parallel to the US in 2019 in a way

Summary

- Franz and his wife are important members of the community
- he is sent to basic training, never sees any fighting
- when France surrenders, he is sent back for training
- he is called up again and has to swear an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler
and the Third Reich
- J&auml;gerst&auml;tter refuses to take the oath, despite pressure from those
around him
- he finds strength in his faith in God and in his wife, even though he knows
he will be arrested and maybe killed
- he is arrested and waits months for his trial, he exchanges letters with his
wife
- he is brutally treated while in prison
- he is finally tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Sites of Memory in U.S.-American Histories and Cultures (Udo J. Hebel)

p. 47

## Conceptual Frameworks and American Memory Studies

- US cultures of memory are shaped by developments since the colonial 
period
- because the US promised redemption (as a country and idea) and because the
multiple ethnicities that conflict, purposeful construction and ongoing 
revision of a multivocal network of sites of memory happened
- for nation building/community preservation we study the political, social, 
and cultural power of imagined communities and invented traditions
- thus the significance of cultural memories and collective commemorations 
for the formation of the US nation can be studied
- the US was created rhetorically and in historical acts of political and
cultural opposition
- we should remember the pre-Columbian achievements and travellers, be less
Anglocentric, there are memories preceding 1492
- American studies is versatile and thus good at accommodating the 
heterogeneity of American cultures of memory and at studying the political 
and economic competition for commemorative participation and authority
- American and memory studies (constructivist and sociocultural approaches) 
mesh well together because of American studies foci on a usable past, 
American civil religion, New Historicist understanding of US culture 
as a rhetorical battlefield

## The Cultural Work of Literary Sites of U.S.-American Memories

- three main types of literary commemoration:
    1. historiographical writings
    2. fictional writings
    3. autobiographical writings
- with European colonization came literary construction of cultural memories
specific to America
- first contacts and conflicts with natives were preserved
- the Puritans (New England) were the most commemorative English-language writers
- there is a US-American commemoration of the Anglocentric origin myth of the
Pilgrim Fathers' arrival at Plymouth Rock in 1620---Thanksgiving
- in the 17th century this myth was perpetuated to set America apart, best said
in _"But whether New England may Live any where else or no [sic], it must Live 
in our History!"_
- they used historiographic scripts to exercise commemorative authority,
especially in times of crises and intercultural conflicts (see officially
sanctioned re-writes of New England history by prominent people)
- after the founding of the U.S.A. construction of historiographical sites
continued---for ideological control and cultural containment (e.g. G.
Bancroft's _History of the United States of America_, from 1837 until the
1880s)
- after the British-American war and the Civil War a ton of historical novels
were published---literary sites of memory---to maintain a national US culture
and identity
- the intentional creation of a US national literature was demanded
- many historical novels dealing with earlier times are written
- regional differences come into play, the South has slavery literature
(plantation literature; apologetic, racist, lost-cause of the Confederacy)
- continues with _Birth of a Nation_, _Gone with the Wind_, _North and South_
- history is still a popular genre, which shows its unbroken cultural power
- autobiographical writings are purposeful acts of individual remembrance
- they also serve the construction of identity in specific cultural and 
intercultural situations
- John Smith---self dramatizing impulse of early promoters of colonization
- self-scrutinizing urge of Puritan writings
- self-perceptions are a big section of the early religious or secular writings
in British North America
- autobiographies of women, ethnic writers, politically or religiously
dissenting writers are useful tools for oppositional, subversive expression
(useful acts of individual remembering)
- American slave narratives stand out in this, they expose the plight of
chattel slavery and the transatlantic slave trade---later resound in writings
of MLK, Malcolm X\dots
- also includes pluralization of ethnicities, away from Anglocentrism and
English-only

## Visual Sites of Memory in an Increasingly Mediated U.S.-American History and Culture

- visual rock art is the oldest form of visual sites of memory in the US
- made by different indigenous groups both pre- and post-Columbian
- these visual sites could have been either abstract, ceremonial, or
representational
- they preserve sacred rites, mythic figures, ancient symbols, specific events
like Spanish massacres
- the visual sites of memory remain part of ceremonial rites, the tourist
business and commemorative industry with national parks in the Southwest
- paintings of _landing scenes_ of Columbus and settlers have a special place
as commemorative constructions of pivotal moments of origin, foundation, and
identity formation
- landing scenes are a big part of active recollection of foundational moments
- John Trumbull’s painting _The Signing of the Declaration of Independence, 4 
July 1776_ (1820) is another such commemoration---creates usable past by
commissioning icons of memory
- these visual sites were widely reprinted and sold, making a connection from
visual sites of memory to commercial interests
- pictorial US histories were also a hit, coming in the times of territorial
expansion
- three iconic site of memory (pre 20th century) are: engraving of the Boston
Massacre, distributed since right after the event; _Washington Crossing the
Delaware_ as _the_ representation of G. Washington as hero; _Westward the
Empire Takes its Way_ as full representation of _Manifest Destiny_
- even _Freedom from Want_ (1943) as recent example that paintings still hold
a lot of power
- photography make visual site of memory a part of US media culture
- Civil War photos were the first photos of important US historical events
- photos replaced all other forms of memorization that were popular before
- ~1900s photos of Native Americans have created the iconic figure of the
vanishing Indian in US (also non-US) memories
- photos became the commemorative instruments for all moments of US history
- TV news and even the internet have contributed to this development
- this has inscribed certain images into collective US memory, like great
sports moments, WWII events, JFK, Vietnam War, Moon Landing, Nixon, 9/11,
Katrina\dots
- movies have a similar influence, some being very culturally ingrained: _Birth
of a Nation_, _Gone with the Wind_, _JFK_, _Amistad_, _Pearl Harbor_
- TV documentaries are also a big part of this remembrance

## Commemorative Performances and Material Displays of U.S.-American Memories

- after creating the US its history and identity needed to be celebrated
- at first many local mashed old traditions with new ones focusing on the
country
- at first it was birthdays of leaders, specific other occurences, or the
ratification of the constitution
- these festivities laid the foundation for a US civil religion---cultural and
cohesive function relies on national sites of memory 
- in the 19th century the 4th of July developed into a national holiday,
beating out Forefathers' Day, when the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth
- around the expansion and Civil War, local festivities gained more traction
- performative memory also became more pluralistic
- Civil War reenactments were a big thing, together with the erection of Civil
War monuments; Gettysburg becoming _the_ icon of it, basically a commercialized
shrine
- African American influence pluralized some of the sites of memory
- history was also further pluralized and localized
- there were some attempts to go back to the monolithic, Anglocentric history
of the Pilgrims
- this monolith still remained powerful if not dominant---there were debates
over the merit of Columbus Day or Forefathers' Day as repressive celebrations
of a Eurocentric vision of the US
- instead a more pluralistic model is proposed that has space for different
ethnic groups
- museums and similar institutions are basically as old as the US itself
- the Library of Congress is the biggest collection of _American Memories_
- local and state historical societies, heritage societies, archives, and 
libraries form a nation, intricate network
- these institutions strongly influence all levels of memory of things
- the Smithsonian Institutions is the epitome of US museum culture (on the
National Mall in DC)
- museum exhibits (Enola Gay) or museum concepts are still controversial and
debated---particularly public and influential sites of memory in the
multi-ethnic US
- the National Mall is a very particular example:
    - it houses the Smithsonian, National Archives, monuments to Jefferson,
    Lincoln, FDR, connects the Capitol, White House, Supreme Court, memorials
    for the Vietnam, Korean, and Second World Wars
    - the national archives have important documents, the capitol rotunda
    paintings of important historical moments on display
    - the National Park Service holds the Mall, together with 400 other
    important historical sites---Independence Hall, Battlefields, Yellowstone,
    Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty
- in addition to that, commercial sites such as living-history plantations or
forts mix historical education with commerce
- whether or not his democratizes history is debated
- coins and stamps are further sites of memory---agents of historical and
cultural memory

## Transnationalization and Virtualization of Sites of U.S.-American Memories

- the fact that the US is multi-ethnic and transnational makes sites of memory
pluralistic---despite of repression, erasure, exclusion, forgetting\dots
- the monolithic surface is more and more being disturbed---renaming Custer
Battlefield National Monument to Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument
and addition of an Indian memorial
- the creation of a Crazy Horse Monument in the style of Mount Rushmore is
another example of that
- more multivocal histories at Ellis Island and in California's Angle Island
- memorials to the Japanese Americans
- US Holocaust Memorial Museum is an American manifestation of the
international memory
- fights over how to best memorialize Ground Zero in NYC show the struggle over
commemorative authority 
- most of these sites are completely available online---making them super
accessible 
- how that will influence pluralization, democratization, commercialization
remains to be seen

## Questions from Handout

### Is Donald Trump and the Republican Party intent upon making America great again by remembering the past or forgetting?

I think they plan on doing both. What the goal of MAGA seems to be is to make
people yearn for a past that never existed, but which Trump promises to bring
back. Selective remembering and forgetting can be very helpful here. Of course
many of his followers want to live better lives. That is not surprising or
strange. To improve their lives though, they seek to move backwards instead of
forwards. This can be appealing because the future is always uncertain, whereas
the past can be known. If one has a distorted, rosy view of the past this idea
becomes even more attractive. Instead of moving towards the uncertain future
and making the best of it, it seems simpler to move back to the past where
everything seemed better. In reality of course, this is nor possible, simply
because external circumstances changed and make past situations impossible.
Furthermore, trying to MAGA implies that America used to be great (again a rosy
view of the past). If America used to be so great, what happened? Why is it so
much worse now? In trying to determine how America became worse, scapegoats
need to be found. If one has a certain political agenda, scapegoats can be
easily found and blamed for the current situation (regardless of how true that
might be). Thus people wishing for a better life that the see in the past can
be turned against scapegoats for obvious political gain. In short, a
combination of remembering the good and desirable things of the past and
forgetting both its unpleasant elements and how the transition between then and
now can make people follow a political campaign that might not be in their own
best interest. 

### Does the argument apply in any ways to Central Asia’s new and evolving self-understanding 

following the collapse of the USSR and Indepedence, to your
own country’s employment of various sites of memory to build a national
consciousness and what might be termed a single ethnic national belief? Can you
come up with any examples? Is this good or bad?\newline As for Central Asia I
cannot say much, but for Kyrgyzstan the focus on Manas as a national hero and
possibly Kurmanjan Datka as another important figure shows an attempt at
building a national identity through cultural commemoration. This includes
studying the Manas epic in schools and universities alike, the various Manas
statues occupying prestigious squares, celebrating the 1000 years of Manas, a
monument at Manas' tomb in Talas\dots As far as change goes, the focus on Manas
is a relatively recent one that came about after the fall of the Soviet Union
when ideological control became relaxed and Kyrgyz independence demanded a
national identity.\newline For Germany's building of a national consciousness
there are a couple different factors. Sites of memory include many of the great
poets, writers, and philosophers of Germany (or German-speaking regions) before
it really was a single country. These figures are known to most people and they
are studied in school. The poets include Goethe, Schiller, Rilke, and Storm.
The philosophers include Kant, Marx, Engels, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Leibniz.
Leibniz was also a great scientist, as well as Copernicus, Kepler, Einstein,
Planck, von Humboldt, and von Braun. More recent sites of memory are WWII
memorials and most of all the ruins-turned-museums of concentration and
extermination camps. Those are an ever-present reminder of our history. More
recently, the fall of the Berlin Wall is an event that many Germans currently
alive lived through and remember. The division of Germany still influences life
in Germany. The poets, writers and scientists are from different eras of German
history---some before "Germany" was a thing---but through their continued
presence in school and people's general awareness of them they create a feeling
of connection between people. WWII and the Holocaust are an even starker
element in the building of a common consciousness. While some people reject the
thought (for different reasons), Germany is the country succeeding the Third
Reich and inherited the responsibility for all those atrocities committed
during WWII---Germany's population after the 8th of May 1945 was still the same
that applauded Hitler in 1933. WWII and the lead up to it occupy a significant
amount of time during school and a visit to a concentration camp is a mandatory
part of every pupil's education. This creates a sense of common history, as
ugly as it might be. The German reunification creates a sense of unity because
now Germany was whole again after being divided by the Allies in 1945. Also it
was a significant historical event that many Germans experienced first-hand.
Often portrayed as the result of a popular movement it represents the German
peoples wish for unity and their rejection of GDR rule.\newline It is difficult
to say whether the creation of a national identity is a good or a bad thing.
For national cohesion and rallying people behind a common cause it seems to be
a proven measure. The downside I see in it is that in choosing a few big
memories, others that might be equally important will be ignored. Furthermore,
selecting some over others will inevitably color the resulting national memory
in some way, even if it is unintentional. This would then distort the
self-perception of the country and its people as well as simply being
incorrect. 

### Are the Americans in trouble, culturally?

I would not say so. Yes,
American culture is based on certain facts and assumptions that may not be
true. It might also be too monolithic and bury smaller subcultures that have
equal right to exist. But as the text lays out, this culture and the way it is
commemorated is continually changing and adapting. It is a slow process, but it
is happening. This means that over time the American culture has a chance to
adapt to the times and to "improve" (whatever exactly that means). Because is
seems possible that this will happen and because there is still movement and
change going on (e.g. BLM protests, civil rights movements) I think that
America will be ok. Also, I don't see a better way to deal with this. Culture
generally changes slowly and dependent on events and developments. - Are there
other countries who have attempted to follow their example, their lead?\newline
Who is they? 

### Should collective sites of memory be torn down if their history is problematic?

I do not think so. Tearing down any physical thing will
not destroy the idea associated with it---it may even strengthen the resolve of
its followers. In some cases it might work, for example renaming sports teams
whose names are racist to something less racist, but this does not always work.
Furthermore, attempting to remove anything from history is dangerous because
who gets to decide what is problematic. Take concentration camps as an example.
They are undoubtedly problematic. But tearing them down is not the solution. On
one hand that would in some way erase the history and the suffering they
caused, lending credit to those who deny their existence (also the Nazis
attempted to destroy them before they had to give them up and one does not want
to finish a Nazi's job). On the other hand, an argument for tearing them down
would be that they keep the memory of those atrocities alive unnecessarily, it
might be better to forget. I disagree here because just because the
concentration camps disappear what happened there is not undone. The current
approach is reasonable in my opinion. Keep the concentration camps in such a
state as they are now and turn them into a place of remembrance where their
history and issues are explained. Then it is up to the visitor to decide what
to think of it. In the end each person has to individually decide how to
interpret things anyways, and tearing down problematic sites of memory will not
guide that process into a better direction (also who decides what that even
is?). I think if a collective site of memory turns out to be problematic but
significant, it should be displayed as such---showing the problematic aspect
and supplying enough information that the visitor/viewer/whatever can form
their own opinion.
