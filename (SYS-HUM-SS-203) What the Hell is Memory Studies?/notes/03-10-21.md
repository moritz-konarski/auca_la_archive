## _Zhazgul_ Democracy in America (Toqueville)

- aristocratic history focuses more on individuals and forgets what the masses
do
- democratic history focuses on the masses and forgets the influence of
individuals
- in aristocratic times people were more connected to their ancestors and their
future relatives, while in democratic societies their ties are severed
- democracy leads to an increase in state power
- democracy can lead to despotism if people have less of a connection to their
ancestors and depend more on the state
- is a majority decision always democratic?
    - 
- does religion help or hinder democracy?
    - 
- what are the main problems facing today's democracy?
    - 
- if people rule in a democracy, are there any genuine democracies in the
world?
    - 
- democracy severs all the connections people had to their ancestors and
descendants, it also separates him from other people
- his ideas were based on the American Revolution and influenced the French
Revolution
- the French revolution was also caused in part by the support they gave to the
American colonies
- the revolutionary period was also a shift in the culture of memory in the
affected countries
- modernity shaped memory studies, and the ideas of modernity were broadcast by
and after the French revolution
- Kantsteiner's chapter can be related to this discussion
- a scientific approach to the human soul lead to a development in memory
studies
- changing social systems influence the way memory is created and how knowledge
is handled
- our social systems and the way we understand them are related
- the core of the issue is how we remember
