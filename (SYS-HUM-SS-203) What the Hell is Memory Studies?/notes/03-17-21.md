## Collective Memory Reader: The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (Karl Marx)

p. 103

- historical reading of coup of Louis Napoleon (nephew of THE Napoleon)
- evidence against his historical determinism
- collective memory is not a central theme, even though later theorists saw
some shit in that
- men make history based on circumstances derived from the past
- especially during revolution previous generations are conjured to borrow
names, slogans etc in time-honored disguise
- one can only really live in the now when all this past shit is forgotten
- French Revolution used Roman slogans and imagery
- bourgeois revolution tends to cover itself in other, older and better
traditions; when the revolution is complete, the old ideals are cast aside
- the old and dead are used for glorification, finding spirit
- a people who thought that power of revolution was with them, now find
themselves in the past and powerless 
- what is important for the future and 19th century revolutions is to let the
dead be dead
- this means that these new revolutions must be satisfied with themselves and
not try to emulate earlier revolutions

## Collective Memory Reader: The Sociological Problem of Generations (Karl Mannheim)

p. 106

## Collective Memory Reader: Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi)

p. 215

- American Jewish historian
- old biblical and rabbinical concepts of time and current Jewish ones
- human civilization is not inherently concerned with history, even though
Western tradition suggests as much
- mythical time is more important in many "primitive" societies--they attach
meaning to things like the dream-time, but the current moment does not have any
of that; only when rituals shatter the distinction does the present have some
weight
- Herodotus (father of history) and his society saw no real value in
history--Herodotus wrote to preserve the deeds of the Greeks and
barbarians--protection against erosion through time
- they also sought moral or political insights from the past
- Jews were the fathers of meaning in history
- ancient Israel assigned meaning to history, a view that Christianity and
Islam would later appropriate
- God's will was manifest in human history 
- suddenly the interaction with god was not here and now, but in history
(divine challenge and human response)
- struggle of gods against chaos replaced by struggle of god against his
creation, man--tense dialectic of obedience and rebellion
- primeval dream-time world is Paradise in Genesis, irrevocably abandoned
- history and historical time begins with Adam and Eve leaving paradise
- man discovers that even in suffering, god reveals himself in the course of
history
- now celebrations are no longer trying to re-gain dream-time, but they
celebrate actual history
- only in Israel is the injunction to remember as a religious imperative to an
entire people
- there may be a desperate pathos about biblical history: human memory is
fleeting
- history can never repeat itself, but mythic time repeats itself
- in light of all that, the covenant is supposed to last forever
- to remember it the bible states to remember the Jordan being split when the
covenant passed
- as Sinai cannot be repeated, what happened there must be carried along with
history and thus transmitted from the forefathers to the present
- biblical appeal to memory has little to do with curiosity, it is about
remembering the important parts
- two channels: ritual and recital
- preserving links to seasonal cycles, passover and tabernacles turned into
Exodus from Egypt and sojourn in the wilderness
- religious need to remember overflowed into actual historical narrative too
- biblical history spanning a millennium is very impressive, even though it is
supposed to show the acts of god it is mostly concerned with the acts of men
and nations
- this was ultimately to be interpreted in religious terms, but it lead to
a giant piece of history
- three elements: meaning of history, memory of the past, writing of history
- in bible they were somewhat connected, afterwards they diverge
- prophets are more likely to transmit collective memory than actual history 
writing
- collective memory mostly transmitted through ritual and not chronicle
- the historical books of the bible (Joshua, Kings, Samuel,...) had to be more
than just history to survive
- they had to turn into sacred, authoritative writings
- when the biblical canon was sealed at Yabneh, these books received an
immortality that subsequent (and even current) books can never achieve (this
theory is actually discredited today)
- for the first time the history of a people became part of its scripture
- this historical stuff was (is) read in synagogues--keeping history alive
- with democratization of Judaism, more people were learning and reciting
history
- why did rabbis not take up where biblical history left off?
- historiography came to a halt even though belief in history remained
- this also lead to a- or anti-historical thought patterns
- a sharp change in Jewish life lead to a change in group memory
- history became the faith of fallen Jews
- history, not a sacred text, was now the arbiter of Judaism
- later ideologies appeal to history for validation
- Jewish historiography must thus be opposed to Jewish history: it must oppose
the divine as the casual and ultimate factor in Jewish history, and the
uniqueness of it
- the secular view of history took way longer to make it's way to Judaism than
any other area
- Jewish history as national history was the only one that was considered
sacred; it could be interpreted purely religiously
- Judaism is inseparable from its evolution through time
- only in 19th century do we find historiography that is separate from Jewish
collective memory
- "The historian," he wrote, "is the physician of memory. It is his honor to 
heal wounds, genuine wounds. As a physician must act, regardless of medical 
theories, because his patient is ill, so the historian must act under a moral 
pressure to restore a nation's memory, or that of mankind" (p. 220)
- historiography cannot replace eroded group memory if it never depended on it
in the first place
- The decline of Jewish collective memory m
modern times is only a symptom of the unraveling of that common network
of belief and praxis through whose mechanisms. . .. the past was once made
present. Therein lies the root of the malady. Ultimately Jewish memory cannot
be "healed" unless the group itself finds healing, unless its wholeness Is
restored or rejuvenated. But for the wounds inflicted upon Jewish life by the
disintegrative blows of the last two hundred years the historian seems at best
pathologist, hardly a physician. (p. 220)
- just read 220 onwards
- every sentence is good

# _Class_ 17.03.2021

- assignment 2 might be on whether or not we need Holocaust memorials
- assignment 3 may be a paper on memory studies itself; alternatively we could
read some of Forsberg's writing and then see what we can say about his memory
or life writing--coming to terms with the past; can we find a topic that
combines my major and memory studies?
- talking about what Nooruz is, also how names and patronymics work here
- now Begimai

## _Begimai_ Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi)

- mythical is more real in "primitive societies" than actual history
- Jews were the first to attach real importance to history
- she is simply reading sections of the text to us
- what is the point of this
- Jews, more than any other group, can read their history completely
religiously
- is it possible to reconstruct historical events with 100% accuracy?
    - not really, because any kind of transmission involves a certain loss of
    information
    - experiencing an event we have a certain connection of the event with the
    past
    - views of the Turkish coup attempt is mostly shaped by people's political
    convictions
    - postmodernists would say true objectivity is impossible and thus true
    reconstruction cannot happen
- use of history:
    - learning from the past: information and strategy and tips
    - try to understand the present by looking to the past§§ Begimai Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi)
    - why do we write history?
- the invention of tradition (B. Anderson):
    - writing as an invention of tradition, especially for nations
- is learning history from a national perspective a good idea?
- history: identity, not repeating the mistakes of the past
- perceptions of god and history change over time--spirit of the age; dominant
thought of the times
- right now the end of the world is coming but people don't really care, while
in some countries people made sense of stuff with reference to a nearing end
times
