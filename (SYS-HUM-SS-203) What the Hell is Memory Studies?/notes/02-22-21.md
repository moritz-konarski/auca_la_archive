# _Class_ 22.02.2021

- start with free writing
- background for free writing
    - ecological disasters made earth unlivable
    - people fought over resources
    - a lucky few managed to escape to a new planet
    - planet was chosed because it is an ecological dictatorship (ecological
    utilitarianism)
    - we believe in equality for all species, promote understanding that allows
    life in harmony
    - because of the dictatorship we have the ministry that is the object of
    the free write
    - dictatorships like people who are not qualified to choose for themselves
- Islambek
    - Republic (Plato), "Invisible Hand" (Smith), Nineteen Eighty-Four (Orwell)
- Begimai
    - "it was hard to only choose 10 authors"
    - Jamila, Manas, Aaly Tokombaev's poems, War and Peace, Anna Karenina,
    some encyclopedia
- Ibragim
    - classic books that give us information about our world
    - science books, War and Peace
- censorship is less oppressive than a canon, but is also decides what is
acceptable
- we can plot against her in her ministry role and then manipulate the
selection process to get our will through
- we focused on preserving literature or information, less on aesthetic values
- now Symbat's presentation

## Free writing

_A series of drastic changes took place and we had to leave Earth for good. We 
need to start a new life on a new planet, where we will represent humankind. 
Together, you and I form The Lucky Thirteen. On this new planet, I am in charge 
of the Ministry of the Preservation and the Promotion of Indispensable Works of 
Literature, and my mission is to choose which literary works from planet Earth 
will be allowed in our new society. You are chosen to be a member of the Most 
Venerable Council of Canon Formation that will guide the ministry throughout
this process. You will nominate at least ten literary works that deserve being 
part of the new canon. Please state reasons for your choice and defend them by 
referring to "Cultural Memory and the Literary Canon". You don’t need to agree 
with Herbert Grabes but you need to explain why you disagree with him and 
clarify your criteria for choosing your works. I have the right to veto the 
works you nominate and I will explain my reasons to do so._

As a general comment I don't see why the ministry would want to exclude certain
works from this new planet. With current technology we could transport all
literary works and not lose any of them. Thus I don't see why we would need to
choose such a limited number of them and basically doom all the other works.

Assuming there is some limitation to the number of literary works, I would try
to select works based on their influence and also by how much information would
be lost if they were not included. To do this well I'd need to know what
exactly "literature" refers to here (i.e. does it include works of science or
are those somehow already there, are computer programs included here or not?).

I would also need to know what my goal is (what are these works supposed to
accomplish?). Would these works be used for nation and identity building, or
would they be used for moral education? What culture are these works from or
what culture are we residing in or trying to build?

Ignoring these questions, the best list I can come up with includes (in no
particular order):

1. Nineteen Eighty-Four (George Orwell): it's dystopian and philosophical, it
   warns of a path in society we should maybe not follow, and for a new society
   this might be important
2. The Lord of the Rings (J. R. R. Tolkien): one of the main works of fantasy
   literature (a personal favorite of mine, admittedly), it shaped most fantasy
   novels since

After she told us her information, these are irrelevant

1. encyclopedias that preserve knowledge
2. environmental philosophy books
3. environmental accounts of what went wrong on earth

## _Symbat_ Cultural Memory and the Literary Canon (Herbert Grabes)

- canon's are representations of cultural values
- books selected in school are representations of cultural values
- canon's are expressions of opinions of social strata
- contain classics of their time, this is debated because this thing always
changes
- feminism is a good example of a canon being updated a little bit
- she is just reading shit to us; once she is asked questions, her English gets
so much worse
- parents (soviet) imposed their canon on children--is this canon relevant in
our current education?
- because the whole canon is kinda sexist, should we widen it to include more
women?
- "our generation is making equality between the genders, we don't really care
anymore if a book is written by a man or a woman"
- one generation influencing another with their literary canon: what should be
done
    - the canon should not change because it played a big role in our education
    - the new canon should be up to the standard of the old books
- the canon is always political, values of society are generally values of
a particular group of people (bourgeoisie)

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Life-Writing, Cultural Memory, and Literary Studies (Max Saunders)

p. 321

- life-writing is contentious because it is such a broad term
- sometimes used when different life-story writings (memoir, autobiography,
biography, diary, letters, autobiographical fiction) are discussed together
- sometimes it is also used because the line between biography and
autobiography is being blurred
- in 18th century the view that all writings is (in some way) autobiographical 
emerged and is still around
- this blurs the line between autobiographical writings and all other forms
- even the most factual thing carries some autobiographical mark
- autobiography not as a genre, but a mode of reading
- biographies tend to quote a ton of material; even autobiographies to that for
some reason, even if they could be pure acts of memory
- some people write about themselves like about someone else to make it easier
- these questions are important for memory studies, as well as cultural memory
- _contract_ between author and reader that author is also subject of the
autobiographical book
- but then how valid is this contract, and what about cases where there is no
contract (like 3rd-person autobiographies)
- this mess makes connecting life-writing to actual experiences hard
- on the other hand, if everything is life-writing, everything can be connected
to cultural memory
- we then must approach all of these text like literary critics and not naively
- these texts reveal memory cultures--how memory is produces, constructed,
written, circulated
- everything to do with memory is always already mediated, by narratives,
textualization, short-term memory; they are "after the event" by definition
- "truth of memory" is debatable, some might match up more with other types of
evidence, but all are falsified as transformed as event or experience
- studying life-writing can make us better cultural historians
- this might also create better literary critics
- certain autobiographical episodes can give insight into formative memory,
from autobiographical point of view
- from a memory studies point of view we can see what happened, and if you have
multiple sources you can build a picture of that cultural memory; if something
is published it is worse because those sources contributed to the formation of
cultural memory too
- biography is central in cultural memory production; anthropologically we are
looking at ancestor worship; defining, celebrating its values
- one type of history writing focuses on great men; they shape history, even
though history is a collection of biographies--contrasts with Marxian view that
economic movements shape history
- other biographies focus on the circumstances that made pretty ordinary people
great
- challenges to life-writing
    - _psychoanalysis_: the self is fragmented and not entirely accessible,
    writers cannot fully access it; 
    - _Marxism_: biography is conservative: it is individualistic and liberal;
    function is to present something that is not true, keep up the illusion;
    but it also delivers important information on class struggle
    - _feminism_: writing the biographies of women that were ignored; they
    could also express all their stuff now; 3 types
        1. write biographies of women
        2. create reference or companion works
        3. contribute to reference works
    other forms of identity politics do the same
    - _fiction_: tries to fictionalize certain elements in cultural memory and
    sometimes gets some flack for it; Anne Frank has become a symbol for this,
    her personal memories give voice to thousands of fates
- making meaning free from the author can be liberating too
- crossing biography and fiction is a 20th century thing
- life-writing was late in receiving a lot of attention from literary critics
- life-writings was in its hay-day in the 19th century
- stupid fucking mumbo-jumbo
