What does it mean to be American?

This question in itself says something. Technically America is made up of two
continents and hundreds of millions of people. But in common usage America
means the United States of America. This fact indicates that being American
means being from the US, at least the way it is commonly used. Maybe this fact
also indicates that being American means being from an important country.
Regardless of one's opinion of America, it is an important country. And why 
else would the continent's name be synonymous with this country? 
America is one of the top 2 most powerful countries in the world (whether China
is more powerful or less I cannot say). With this comes a certain feeling of
being important as a country and, stereotypically, Americans are proud of their
country. More recently it seems being American either means being a gun-toting,
conservative, Republican redneck or a super-liberal Democrat. The political
system of the US seems to reflect this split along two opposing political
camps. With a two-party system there seems to be no room for middle ground, you
must either be for my party and my beliefs or for the _others_, the opponents,
the enemies. Maybe being American means being divided. On one hand many
Americans seem to share some common beliefs like freedom, building ones own
destiny, etc but they vehemently disagree about how this should work. Should
freedom include the freedom for corporations to destroy the environment and
exploit their workers? Or should for example peoples' freedom to carry guns be 
curtailed in some way to reduce the exorbitant number of gun deaths the US has?
Honestly, I don't know what it means to be American and looking at what's 
happening in the US right now shows that neither do Americans.

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Sites of Memory and the Shadow of War (Jay Winter)

- p. 61

## Quotes

- "Sites of memory are places where groups of people engage in public 
activity through which they express “a collective shared knowledge [...] of the
past, on which a group’s sense of unity and individuality is based” (Assmann 
15)." (p. 61)
- "Commemoration at sites of memory is an act arising out of a conviction, 
shared by a broad community, that the moment recalled is both significant and 
informed by a moral message. Sites of memory materialize that message." (p. 62)
- "The critical point about sites of memory is that they are there as
points of reference not only for those who survived traumatic events, but
also for those born long after them. The word “memory” becomes a
metaphor for the fashioning of narratives about the past when those with
direct experience of events die off. Sites of memory inevitably become
sites of second-order memory, that is, they are places where people remember 
the memories of others, those who survived the events marked there." (p. 62)

## Introduction

- _sites of memory_: places where groups of people publicly express and share
knowledge of the past
- this past is the basis of the group's unity and individuality---it is
defining for the group
- through these actions the group inherits earlier meanings attached to the
event but also new meanings
- this activity is the defining element of presentation and preservation of
commemorative sites
- without these groups, the sites of memory lose their initial force and
purpose and my fade away entirely
- here _site of memory_ means a physical site where people go to commemorate
something
- in the 20th century most of these places commemorated war and death
- phases:
    1. creative phase: construction or adaptation for a specific purpose
    2. institutionalization and routinization of their use
    3. in many cases a phase of forgetting, where the site fades away together
       with the social group that started it
- these sites of memory have become more common in modern times---they did
exists before that, but not in these numbers
- here focus is on the time of the nation state, i.e. 19th and 20th century
- in modern times events of remembrance were distinct from religious events
    - Armistice Day (11.11. for WWI) is decently close to All Saints Day
    (01.11. Catholic) and in some places they were interchangeable
    - the end of WWII in Europe (08.05.1945) is the Saint's Day of Joan of Arc
- moments of national humiliation are rarely commemorated, except:
    - "Never Again" for Israeli Day of Remembrance for Nazi victims
    - shells of buildings in Hiroshima are also that
- Where moral doubts persist about a war or public policy, commemorative sites
are either hard to fix or places of contestation. (p. 62)
    - you cannot commemorate the Algerian War in France, Vietnam War in the US
    - there is no moral consensus about the conflict and thus no consensus on
    how and when and what should be remembered
- sites of remembrance are often multifaceted---contested, embittered
    - shrines to war dead in Japan---both normal soldiers and war criminals lay
    there
    - same for German war cemeteries 

## Commemoration and Political Power

- a good part of the debate over sites of memory concerns their use as
instruments of dominant political elements
- public events can be used to establish the legitimacy of political rule
    - some events are held regardless of who is in power, see Bastille Day in 
    Paris or Independence Day in the US
    - others are tied to the ruling elite, November 7 as date of the Bolshevik
    Revolution, the parade was a demostration of power and pride
    - top-down approach
    - sites of memory: materialization of national, imperial, or political 
    identity
    - for Australia it is the day when AUS and NZ troops landed in Turkey in
    WWI (Gallipoli ladings)
- not all sites of memory are associated with warfare
- birthdays are welcome: Queen Victoria's birthday (04.05.) was Empire Day, not
Commonwealth Day
- these days were part of a movement of "the invention of tradition."
- ceremonies that are rooted in a distant past and connected to it can cover
political innovation, instability, or insecurity
- these types of traditions are not really bound to specific places
- this is a functionalist interpretation
- a different approach focuses on how sites of memory can allow dominated
groups to contest their subordination publicly
- the "official script" can be "reinterpreted" and subverted
- Armistice Day for example was being used as a commemoration of military
service, but pacifists used it to say "Never again" and to denigrate military
values
- this approach emphasizes the multi-vocal nature of remembrance and the
opportunity to change what sites of memory stand for and are used for
- there is always a chorus of voices in commemoration
- in some cases dissonant voices come together for common remembrance, but then
there is no single place where it takes place
    - two-minute silence on 11.11. 11 am from 1919 and 1938 in GB
    - in those two minutes most people thought not about victories of armies, 
    but about the people they lost, the men who weren't there
    - it was a meditation about absence 
    - thus it was less political and more family history
    - "the richest texture of remembrance was always within family life. This 
    intersection of the public and the private, the macro-historical and the 
    micro-historical, is what has given commemoration in the twentieth century 
    its power and its rich repertoire of forms. But the very complexity of 
    these processes means that sites of memory are not always the foci of acts 
    of remembrance." (p. 65)
- sites of memory can also be unofficial, not designated by design, but because
of what happened there, by those who lived important moments there
- official certification is not necessary when groups of people act on their 
own
- unofficial sites are preserved through the time and money of groups of people

## The Business of Remembering

- sites of memory cost money and time to construct and preserve 
- they require specialists' services and continued funding
- two types of expenditure: capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure
- land must be purchased, symbolic form must be designed, constructed
- this requires large sums of public money 
- the fine details are mentioned in the text
- if the project is national, all these steps are scrutinized by the public and
by committees
- even on a local level this happens, but there tends to be less publicity
- difference of memorials in Protestant vs Catholic countries: Protestant
memorials tend to have some utilitarian part, Catholic ones never do
- in many cases public funding has to supported by private funding to pay for
memorials, especially in protestant countries, e.g.
    - memorial wards in hospitals, memorial scholarships in schools and 
    universities, alongside memorial cricket pitches and memorial water troughs 
    for horses. In the United States and in Australia there are memorial 
    highways
- recurrent expenses are always born by taxpayers, in Germany christian groups
take care of war cemeteries
- this is also caused by the fact that many memorials become public property
once they are finished, thus the public needs to maintain them
- a bunch of the effort with sites of memory comes from getting the public to
remember in public---one has to get them to sites of memory
- many towns in Europe have WWI and WWII memorials where ceremonies are held
- every church has a plaque with the names of the fallen
- all of these forms of remembrance require the public to travel a little from
their homes
- because both world wars were so spread out, travel is an integral part of
remembrance and the industry
- these voyages start as a pilgrimage and turn into tourism
- one needs to travel there, find food and lodging, get guides, buy flowers,
trinkets, mementos, visit museums
- this whole thing is hardly new, it's simply a different form of the old,
religious pilgrimage in the middle ages (San Juan de Compostela in the middle
ages) 
- pilgrimage to war cemeteries is public commemoration of long distances
- where pilgrimage turns into tourism is hard to say, but business is always
there

## Aesthetic Redemption

- sites of memory are more than just political gestures and material tasks
- sites are also forms of art: creating, arranging, interpreting signifying
practices
- this can be analyzed on an aesthetic level and on a semiotic level, both are
related
- national commemorations can either be unique or shared between nations
- France has Marianne as a symbol, Germany the iron cross and Teutonic
influences
- after WWI many commemorations were medieval in character, in many countries
- these had heroic and divine fighters (individual combat), not artillery and
human flesh
- it was represented with romance and chivalry; all sides of the war did that
- some of these were even in churches, giving it a sacred character
- most of these memorials were not really focused on victory, they emphasized
the "lost generation" and the suffering and loss
- Christian motifs were common, e.g. the grieving mother which brought women
into the national grief and remembrance
- in Protestant countries war memorials were often obelisks because crosses
were seen as too "Catholic"
- in France memorials were supposed to be on public and secular ground, but
people found ways around those restrictions
- 20th century warfare made grieving a common thing, where before mercenaries,
volunteers and professionals fought common, drafted men took their place
- thus everyone was affected by loss in war
- in GB, Germany, France almost every household lost someone, many of whom did
not even have a grave
- as a result memorials highlighted names more than anything else, it was all
that remained of them---these were the sites of local and national
commemoration
- in few cases (Australia), war memorials listed the names of all those who
fought
- with memorials alphabetical order of names replaced social and military rank
- the reason was that people only had the names of the dead to remember them
by, and those should be easily accessible
- this way of naming stayed around for far longer
- sometimes WWII dead were simply added to WWI memorials, both because they are
connected, and because it was simpler and cheaper
- towards the end of the 20th century abstraction became the main tool for
commemorative expression---fewer national symbols and human figure
- Soviet commemorative art is an exception, it stuck to its guns---heroic
romanticism---WWII called the Great Patriotic War
- forms suggesting emptiness and absence were popular
- Holocaust remembrance is a good example of this
    - sites of memory: concentration and extermination camps, places of
    residence before the Shoah
    - has to be different from world war commemoration
        1. cannot have Christian symbols
        2. orthodox Jews resist representational art
        3. there is no uplifting meaning, purpose, or meaning at all
    - "The third was the absence of any sense of uplift, of meaning, of purpose 
    in the deaths of the victims. Those who died in the Holocaust may have 
    affirmed their faith thereby, but what is the meaning in the murder of one 
    million children? To a degree, their deaths meant nothing, and therefore 
    the Holocaust meant nothing." (p. 69)
    - representing nothing is a challenge
    - post-modern forms suggesting disorientation, void, emptiness
    - Libeskind: Star of David taken apart or Lightning bolt in stone and glass
    - since the '70s Holocaust and WWII remembrance go hand-in-hand
    - WWI memorials sought for some kind of meaning in all the killing, also
    a "Never again", even though that lasted like 20 years
    - after WWII the search for meaning became way more complex
    - "Finally, the extreme character of the Second World War challenged the 
    capacity of art—any art—to express a sense of loss when it is linked to
    genocidal murder or thermonuclear destruction." (p. 70)
    - Auschwitz defies conventional meaning, Hiroshima and Nagasaki do so as
    well
    - "Sites of memory are places where people affirm their faith that history 
    has a meaning. What kind of site is appropriate where the majority of 
    people see no meaning at all in the events being marked in time and in 
    space?" (p. 70)
    - Auschwitz and Nagasaki cannot be ignored but they also don't fit into
    normal frameworks

## Ritual

- "Public commemoration is an activity defined by the gestures and words of
those who come together at sites of memory to recall particular aspects of
the past, their past." (p. 70)
- commemorative rituals are more complex than just reading a text
- "Inevitably, commemoration overlaps with political conflicts, but it can 
never be reduced to a direct function of power relationships." (p. 70)
- ritual has three stages
    1. construction of the commemorative form
    2. grounding of ritual action in the calendar, then routinization
    3. transformation or disappearance as active sites of memory
- July 1, 1916 (beginning of the Battle of the Somme) is still observed by some
people---they don't have national legislation, the rituals are locally defined
- in France November 11 is a national holiday, in GB it is not
- "Public commemoration flourishes within the orbit of civil society.
This is not true in countries where dictatorships rule; Stalinist Russia
smashed civil society to a point that it could not sustain commemorative
activity independent of the party and the state (Merridale). But elsewhere,
local associations matter. And so do families. Commemorative ritual survives 
when it is inscribed within the rhythms of community and, in particular, 
family life." (p. 71)
- commemoration only lasts when national and family history overlap
- people at these event bring with them the memory of family members that liven
through these events
- this personal connection makes people commemorate wars and revolutions long
gone---their grandparents might have told them about it
- in some cases a household itself can become a site of memory---remembering
a dead loved one or something like that
- "When the link between family life and public commemoration is broken, a 
powerful prop of remembrance is removed. Then, in a short time, remembrance 
atrophies and fades away." (p.72)
- family transmission of narratives is an essential part of public
commemoration
- public reinforcement can stave off this process, but the event will become
hollow
- when they face away, the sites can be revived and re-appropriated
- the purpose of the site can change, but most just fade away
- "they arise out of the needs of groups of people to link
their lives with salient events in the past. When that need vanishes, so
does the glue that holds together the social practice of commemoration." (p. 72)
- collective memory fades away and sites of memory decompose
- some sites of memory can reappear after being forgotten
- people can always choose to revive the memory of the commemorated moment
- vanishing is not always meant literally, they can simply fade from memory and
become effectively invisible
- "Public commemoration is both irresistible and unsustainable. Constructing 
sites of memory is a universal social act, and yet these very sites are as 
transitory as are the groups of people who create and sustain them." (p. 73)
- sites of memory are always changing, appearing, reappearing, vanishing
