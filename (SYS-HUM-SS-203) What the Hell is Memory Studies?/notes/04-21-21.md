# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Disturbing Memories (Richard Sennett)

p. 297

- working class conscious analysis
- memory contains the endless struggles that have made us what/who we are
(Darwinian)
- traces of conflict, failure, disaster are not erasable in time; no solace in
truths of memory
- nostalgia is memories lie (Marx)
- truthful memory requires courage, nostalgia does not; pain becomes thicker if
we remember well
- what we remember gives no solace, but maybe how
- remembered pain can be objectified
- sharing memory draws us closer together; solidarity through common
remembrance
- cm is source of social strength even if memories are not objective at all
- mythic properties are essential here
- more voices of memory tell a more accurate story; don't privatize memory
- how do people make sense of capitalism?
- people's record of his change is weird, they deny injuries; cm creating myth
and not fact
- wounds of memory need objective memory; needs pluralistic voices (group);
modern economy works against that
- needs a group where people can remember across differences
- verbal conflict forms social bonds between parties (arguing implies caring
what other people think)
- why is this not happening for unemployment, why is memory not confrontation
with capitalism's pains
- economic system is individualizing; strips away collective supports against
economic dislocation, behavior as isolated entrepreneurs
- individualized insecurity makes life highly unstable and uncertain; sense of
self is hard to find; memory comes in here
- shared memory can yield a subjective solidarity; can yield stable inner life
- possess ourselves through memory
- memory becomes private property, something that needs to be protected
- capitalism encourages this; companies want to move fast and not be stuck in
the past, thus they don't care about loyalty but moving and changing
- work of recalling is negative; corps have to interest in their own history
- people will express their memories in a way that empowers and solidifies
remembering; sharing this creates bonds of loyalty and trust
- shared memories do not protect workers from the world, they focus on what
they should have done when there still was time
- they do not remember well because the modern economy does not encourage that
- private empowerment is the answer, collectively collude on that
- sense of time is victimized by economy that does not care about stability,
memory, etc and the way people construct their own memories
- how can we make the time that we lived matter in the conduct of our lives?
- shortness of economic time seems to make our experienced time insignificant

# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Toward a Cultural Theory of Trauma (Jeffrey Alexander)

p. 321

- trauma not as inherent, but as ascription of meaning to events
- cultural trauma as horrendous event that happened to a group of people;
leaves marks on group consciousness, marking memory forever
- constructing cultural trauma -> identify the existence of human suffering and
take on responsibility for it
- taking on moral responsibility allows sharing of suffering of other groups
- other's suffering might also be our own
- social groups can also ignore other's trauma; cannot achieve moral stance
- not only refuse responsibility, but make the victims responsible in a way
- trauma is everywhere; basically an unforeseen, unwelcome, and sudden shift
- trauma does not naturally exist, it is constructed; it's also not an
attribute of an event, it is attributed to it
- some events may only become traumatizing in retrospect, but that is as
traumatizing as anything else
- the actual effect is not really important, but the belief in their abrupt,
harmful change of collective identity
- collective's identity gives individuals a frame of reference (cultural frame
of reference)
- only if patterned meanings are abruptly dislodged does trauma happen
- meanings cause shock, not event itself
- process affected by power structures
- for social crises to become trauma they must become cultural crises
- event must become part of identity to become traumatic
- carrier groups as collective agents of the trauma process, they can "make
meaning" and can be any social group
- representing trauma means new framework for cultural classification / telling
a new story
- storytelling is complex, multivalent, contested, polarizing
- to convince a larger group that they too experienced trauma the carrier
groups must make meaning
- experiencing trauma: collective painful injury, established victim,
attributes responsibility, distributes consequences
- traumas revise collective identity
- also leads to reexamination of collective past
- there is a "calming down" period; stuff calms down, "lessons" are learned
from trauma, memorials are constructed, new identity rooted in sacred places,
ritual routines
- the fervor around the trauma will face away (maybe with resistance)
- they still have a profound impact on social life
- failure to recognize traumas is not a feature of the trauma, but a failure in
the _trauma process_ (carrier groups to weak, weak narratives, small audiences,
\dots)
- no new moral responsibility definitions
