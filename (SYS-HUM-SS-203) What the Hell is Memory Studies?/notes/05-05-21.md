# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Present Pasts: Media, Politics, Amnesia (Andreas Huyssen)

p. 444

- preoccupation with past instead of the future
- but "past cannot give us what the future has failed to deliver"
- recently the past has been privileged over the future in Western societies
- began in 1960s with decolonization and social movement that needed their own
histories
- securing the future -> taking responsibility for the past
- is a boom in memory accompanied by a boom of forgetting?
- too much memory makes system unstable, triggering a fear of forgetting?
- old models of memory cannot reflect current dynamics; can we even have these
models today?
- why fear of forgetting now? memory as anchor in an uncertain world?
- new media is an important part in modern memory concepts
- huge commodification of events such as the Holocaust, we cannot think of
these events outside that, also it is not necessarily bad
- gap between reality and its representations
- "musealization" not just in museums, but obsession with the past in all
areas, also more obsolescence
- memory and musealization as bulwarks against forgetting

# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Reasons for the Current Upsurge in Memory (Pierre Nora)

p. 451

- recent awakening of a new memory focus
- creation of new traditions, readings, interpretations of history
- memorialist trend setting score with the past
- shattered unity of historical time
- we cannot anticipate the future, so we stockpile
- end of history whose end is known
- acceleration of history--it abruptly distances us from the past
- memory has become so broad that is basically a replacement for history
- two effects on memory: leads to stockpiling; autonomising of the present,
it's already overlaid with awareness of its own 
- democratization of history is also a thing: emergence of memory bound to
specific smaller groups
- this is generally due to different types of decolonialization
