# _Class_ 20.02.2021

- different languages can give us tools to deal with the past
- different words that can be used can give us insight,
Vergangenheitsbew&auml;ltigung
- we can also see _amnesia_ and _amnesty_
- care should be taken with narratives, who presents it, what are their
goals/perspectives, can the audience understand it, what is the audience we are
targeting?
- making connections between readings is important
- free writing
- is there a duty to remember those who experienced (suffered in) certain 
events?
- Rakhilya's text presentation
- cosmopolitan memory--everything that happened to everyone in the world is
important--then how do you judge any of it
- __look into grand narratives or master narratives__
- how should the trauma of perpetrators be treated?
- trauma is inaccessible because some elements of human nature are inaccessible
- interdisciplinary work can be difficult because methods might not be adapted
to a different field--it can lead to wrongful application, selective data
usage, etc

## Free writing

First 4 minutes of <https://thoughtmaybe.com/white-light-black-rain/>

- WWII footage of the Imperial Japanese, then WWII Europe
- Pearl Harbor--a day that will live in infamy, then see battles, kamikazi
- bombing runs on japan, then nuclear bombs
- this is the story of some people who survived this nuclear attack
- asking people on the street what happened on Aug 6 in 1945
- 75% of the Japanese population was born after 1945

From her quote

- forgetting as a way to make peace
- speaking inciting shit was forbidden, even had a new term in 'to remember
what is bad'

Forgetting as a way to reconciliate different peoples or groups can certainly
work, but I don't think it is the right way to go. Forgetting about the atomic
bombs is not going to undo the events and bring the tens of thousands of people
back to life. 

I cannot come up with anything good.

To be fair to the Japanese people they talked to, they would have 
probably known something about the events, but possibly not the dates. 

## _Rakhilya_ Against the Concept of Cultural Trauma (Wulf Kansteiner and Harald Weilnböck)

- a lot of the time in her life people told her not to worry about little
things---can you measure different "levels" of trauma against each other?
- can you compare traumata--central question in memory studies

1. what is the best medium to convey trauma?
2. do you believe trauma is inaccessible to memory?
3. can you measure different traumata against each other?
4. if yes, how can you compare and why?

## Metanarrative

- A metanarrative (also meta-narrative and grand narrative; French: métarécit) in 
critical theory and particularly in postmodernism is a narrative about
narratives of historical meaning, experience, or knowledge, which offers
a society legitimation through the anticipated completion of a (as yet
unrealized) master idea (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative>)
- Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward
metanarratives. The narrative function is losing its functors, its great
hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being
dispersed in clouds of narrative language ... Where, after the metanarratives,
can legitimacy reside?
- metanarratives should give way to petits récits, or more modest and
"localized" narratives, which can "throw off" the grand narrative by bringing
into focus the singular event
- Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on specific
local contexts as well as on the diversity of human experience. They argue for
the existence of a "multiplicity of theoretical standpoints"[12] rather than
for grand, all-encompassing theories

# Notes Cultural Memory Studies: Cultural Memory and the Literary Canon (Herbert Grabes)

p. 311

- remembering is selective, group remembrance even more so
- this process is called a canon
- canon = objectification of values, have prestige in the cultural framework
- collective values influence the validity of the canon
- groups promote different canons in a single culture
- canons still last a long time
- cultural memory: "the characteristic store of repeatedly used texts, images 
and rituals in the cultivation of which each society and epoch stabilizes and 
imports its self-image; a collectively shared knowledge of preferably (yet not 
exclusively) the past, on which a group bases its awareness of unity and 
character" (p. 311)
- canons keep stuff in memory for the purpose of unity
- they are social and political tools and that are constantly negotiated
- the canon serves the rich and powerful; it can be abolished to make room for
pick-and-mix
- literary canons are super important because that's what's taught in college
and school
- this canon has different facets (national, international, "high", "popular")
- marginalized groups of course disagree with these monolithic canons
- canons are linked to the different cultures of memory
- who makes the curriculum has cultural power
- a lot of factors shape the literary canon (313-314)
- canons are not only created by critics or authorities alone, so abolishing
them is rather difficult
- canons are vehicles of national politics, narratives
- they kind of create the concept of "literature"
- they also create a literary "usable past"
- evaluating canons is dependent on experiences and also cultural factors
- the number of works in a canon is also an important aspect
- generally there is a very stable core, then an eminent group surrounding
those that change more over time as literary criticism changes, and then less
and less attention is paid to more and more rapidly changing authors
- any canon, especially the British one, is "a vehicle for national, racial and
gender superiority"
- more recently women authors have been included more often (through work of
feminists and historians)
- literary historians are fond of tradition $\rightarrow$ nothing changes
quickly
- to abandon the canon would be to jettison cultural memory
