# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: The invention of tradition revisited: The case of colonial Africa (Terence Ranger)

p. 289

Vansina

- invention of tradition in non-Western settings
- because tradition is invented it is difficult to track identity
- historians don't like tradition because it is the lack of change while they
look for change
- can also be used to legitimize stuff held on other grounds
- tradition invoked to describe the historical consciousness of a group
- cultural and traditional roots of equatorial Africa go back 4-5k years, but
people have shied away from it; it was rejuvenated from time to time
- invention by tradition, not of tradition
- western scholars assuming that African traditions were unchanging and thus
never innovated or changed for the better
- tradition is a set of values that can be built upon and elaborated in various
different ways and with different outcomes
- colonial conquest only needed 40 years to destroy the traditions
- instead of having traditions be the source of invention, colonial governments
became the source
- the Europeans built something that made sense in their mind but not in
tradition and then imposed it on the people
- traditions are processes, they must change to stay alive, they need autonomy
- recovering self-determination after independence was no solution
- now they had no tradition to go back on and thus "Today the people of
Equatorial Africa are "still bereft: of a common mind or purpose.""
- pluralism of 20th century Africa implies end of great tradition and impotence
of modern African thought

Feierman

- long-term duration and active creation are compatible; can lead to
mystification, but choosing a particular discourse is an active act 
- pluralism is the essence of creativity
- invention is too one-sided, it presupposed an inventor, they always were
Europeans
- it is also a too once-for-all event, it leaves no space for change or
development
- this idea can hold analysis back, even though it gives a good contrast to
earlier fluidity and colonial rigidity
- this topic has to be approached correctly
- change in power structures and use of invented traditions even after Europe
stopped using it
- he prefers imagined to invented (except for cases where administrators did
just that) because customary law, ethnicity, religion, language were all
imagined by many people over a long time
- they were in constant tension and contestation with each other -> imagining
something further
- traditions were re-imagined by different groups of people
- imagine stresses the importance of symbols, ideas, images
- traditions are about identity, and that is about imagination

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study (Orlando Patterson)

p. 293

- slavery is form of social death, "natal alienation" (severing of a right to
ancestry), alienation from patrimony is central to establishing nonpersonhood
essential for slavery
- slavery was usually seen as a substitute to violent death
- it was not a pardon, but a conditional commutation as long as the slave
remained powerless
- master was a ransomer who held the claim to the slaves life
- slaves had no existence outside their master and thus became nonpersons and
socially dead
- natal alienation: no right or claim of birth -> no membership in any social
order; secular excommunication
- no claims to any ancestors, genealogical isolate
- had a past, but not a heritage
- slaves were not free to ingrate the experience of the ancestors into their
life, not able to use conscious community of memory
- trying to reach out meant struggle with the master, his community and laws,
policemen and patrollers
- they always had strong social ties between themselves, but no relationships
were ever officially recognized or binding
- the master had the power to remove sexual partners from one another, children
from their parents, people from their communities, or to have sex with the
slaves
- in the 17th century there was almost no difference between black and white
servitude (slave == servant)
- then a distinction emerged between white and black: they did not belong to
the group of civilized white Europeans (first religious, then racial)
- a big "we-they" thing; difference was needed between them
- slaves were total outsiders
- alienation from both ancestors and descendants
- acceptance was in the power of the master over symbolic instruments, also he
had the only connection between the social world and the socially dead slaves
- masters used special rituals when acquiring one: naming, clothing, hairstyle,
language, body markings, symbols of religion
- natal alienation is perpetual and inheritable; not the loss of political or
social liberty, but perpetuity of that loss
- slaves had no claim to their children so that master could take them and also
because their upbringing incurred a debt to him; no one had any interest in the
child so the master took it, child had no claim

# _Class_ 19.04.2021

- great emphasis on post-colonial literature in many countries
- post-colonialism in memory studies is also a thing
- application of "imagined communities" to post-colonial Africa
- significant part of identity construction is based on tradition, they are
invented (not like customs, pre-modern ways of doing things)
- invention of tradition: using old elements to create a new tradition
- Ottomans never used the caliphate term against other muslims, but after they
lost power, they tried to use it to reassert their power
- ancient materials are always there, but they are not used until someone has
need for them to create something new
- in the last 10 years this caliphate idea has become popular in Turkey again
- customs: ancient materials not utilized with purpose in mind, different from
traditions
- you cannot assume that any society has been stable for 1000s of years, it is
just bogus
- assuming static cultures before colonization makes the impact of colonization
even more clear, but it is also a racist perception of no progress in those
countries
- for this tradition we have 1000s of years in Africa and only centuries in
America and Europe -> idea of home and belonging changes
- idea of immigrants from different cultures in the far right: you don't belong
here, and you should go back to where you come from
- sometimes people go too post-colonial or anti-colonial and ignore "bad"
things about local cultures
- Islambek's presentation
- slavery as total erasure of identity: can we explain the African American
culture (music, cuisine, etc) through this
- using Django as an example to talk about slavery lol
- mulatos: to black to be white, to white to be black
- SA slave owners were different, they have policies to assimilate slaves to
their culture
- many different slave uprisings, but the slave owners were smart about keeping
slaves separated and in the dark so that they could not organize effectively
- Malcolm X as a big figure in the civil rights movement, the X as a symbol of
lost heritage and also as rejection of slave owner given last names
- he was also muslim and saw it as going to back to the roots
- this might be an example of invented tradition on his part
- nonetheless, forced conversion to Christianity was a central part of slave
owning
- addressing the experiences of slaves without talking about the slave owners
is questionable, as they were directly involved in the suffering
- you should not erase the slave owner from the equation

## _Islambek_ Slavery and Social Death (Orlando Patterson)

- Harvard professor and social scientist, concerned with racial issues
- natal alienation and social death are conditions for slavery
- slaves did not have any useful or social ties because the master could sever
all of them at will
- slaves were not able to have ancestors or descendants as they could not claim
either
- they were inter-slave communities, but those were never binding and could be
ended any time
- no obligations between parents and their children; masters had the right to
the slave women
- slaves are outcast, constrained by law, police, master, slave patrols
- a bunch of weird, slightly off-topic questions
- some serfs could not be sold, which is a marked difference from slavery
- were slaves totally alienated, or were they just putting up a facade to
protect themselves
