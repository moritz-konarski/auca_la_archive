- my last presentation today
- second period of memory studies
- revival after a bit, cosmopolitan memory
- recently there has been a movement to find an alternative to cosmopolitan
memory models
- talking about national identities
- racism and prejudice in certain countries
- thinking globally: can we think of the world 
- being a world-citizen in a way; thinking in transnational terms we have to
discuss issues of contact between cultures
- politics is also a really important
- cannot tell the story of the British without telling the story of the Empire
and the colonized countries
- Michael Rothberg: multidirectional memory
- when you try to understand an issue in historical terms, it can contribute to
the understanding of another issue
- Hitler might have started the hatred-filled extermination, but how did he
mobilize most people to do this and participate in this?
- talking only about the Holocaust is taking attention away from what happened
to Native Americans
- can we think of national identities not based on heroic narratives
- cosmopolitan memory is based on victimhood
- thinking of people only as victims takes away their agency and makes them
powerless
- we can use the "victimhood" to deprive people of their agency and it can
bring about populist responses
- what can be the alternative? using the term "survivor"
- when controversial issues come up, we need to look at what makes us identify
with a certain thing
- being reflexively self-critical can help us be aware of our own prejudices
