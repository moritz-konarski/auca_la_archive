# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Truth and Method (Hans-Georg Gadamer)

- this text is incredibly dense
- hermeneutics (studying texts) lives between people having a traditional
connection to a text and it being a separate historical object
- it must clarify the conditions in which understanding takes place
- the real meaning of a text does not depend on what the author wanted, but on
the context in which it is read
- we should not see distance in time as a problem and try to think ourselves
into the past, but we should take this distance as a strength
- sometimes it is better to interpret something old because all the concurrent
things that might have messed up the true meaning of the thing
- true meaning can only be discovered with some temporal distance
- the process of understanding and finding the true meaning is infinite because
we always discover new shit
- one needs to be aware of one's prejudice to be able to see past it
- understanding begins when something addresses us
- suspension of our own prejudices is required
- we cannot just cast aside prejudice, it needs to be considered fully in
connection to the other prejudice
- historical thinking must be aware of itself

## _Ibragim_ Confino Text

- argues against reduction of memory to politics
- memory is not just an instrument of politics
- which part of the memory is the most important
- when it comes to politics, we are talking about a ruling class that rules top
to bottom, ruling class shapes memory top to bottom
- 3rd assignment on what memory studies is
- memory is an attempt to resist the power of history--lower social classes
wanting to be remembered and us remembering what happened to them
- personal is political: there is an inter-relation between personal and
political; personal <=> political
- resistance from the bottom is also political
- is bride kidnapping a memory practice? Certainly not lol, it is kind of
a made up tradition
- some people claim it is from Manas, but it actually is not and they just made
it up
- keeping the patriarchy running by the way the bride kidnapping works; it's
not just about rights of the individuals, it keeps the economic and cultural
systems running
- how should we remember COVID-19, how would you tell them about your
experience (someone born after it happened)
- relating current anti-Asian violence to Black Death anti-Semitic tendencies
- political aspect of this is the assigning of blame to other places
- one problem is that humans have a right to rule the world
- many policies are informed by political or social concerns
- how political events are being remembered will generally have a political
dimension
