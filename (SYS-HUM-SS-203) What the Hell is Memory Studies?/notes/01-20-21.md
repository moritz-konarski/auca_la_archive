# _Class_ 20.01.2021

- Trump is basically done, Biden is trying to look as different as possible
- normally the leaving President welcomes the new one
- they apparently planted thousands of flags on the green where people would
normally watch the inauguration
- they are a memorial to the 400,000 dead from Covid
- in a speech there he said something---free writing is on that

## Free writing

We have to remember in order to heal. Remembering as healing.

Biden may be trying to take a course opposite to Trump's. Throughout the
pandemic Trump has always tried to ignore, downplay, or forget about it. By
extension he also ignored all the people suffering from it. For those who lost
someone to Covid this situation may be hurtful because the people who are
supposed to be fighting the crisis that took your loved one don't even
recognize its existence. In a situation like that healing seems difficult. 

Biden saying we have to remember to heal means we need to accept what happened. 
By remembering what happened we recognize the people that died and the hurt of
those who lost someone. Accepting events can be the first step towards working
through them. If one is in denial about what happened it is impossible to work
through it. How can you work through something that you pretend has never 
happened? 

Forgetting any of this ever happened might also work as a solution, but it
seems impossible in practice. If one could truly forget about the whole
disaster one might be ok. But with the incredible influence Covid and the
deaths have had on many peoples' lives it seems impossible to forget all of it.
Something would always remind of the things that were never addressed and
almost forgotten.

If this remembering to heal works, people might be able to forget in time, but
they would forget after having properly dealt with the situation.

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Memory in Post-Authoritarian Societies (Andreas Langenohl) 

p. 163

## Transitions from Authoritarianism: Democratization and the Role of Memory

- coping with authoritarian legacy is tricky, but necessary to build
a democracy in its wake
- how can the transition be secured, how can the institutions be rooted in
culture ("democratic consolidation")
- three waves
1. 19th century--post WWI: 
    - monarchies being overthrown
    - no one gave any thought to their remembrance
2. after WWII
    - German and Italy, Japan stripped of colonies and democratized from the 
    outside 
    - then a bunch of European colonies became independent and wanted 
    democracy
    - here were questions about how to remember fascism, national socialism, 
    imperial colonialism
    - Germany focused on individual and elite guilt first (Nuremberg, Auschwitz 
    trials)
    - postcolonial had cultural dimension: official languages, arts\dots
3. overthrow of authoritarian regimes in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Latin
   America in the '70's
    - all three were problematic (conflict between politically pragmatic and 
    judicially/morally just)
    - all 3 had impunity for the fighters against democracy
    - this did further democratic transition but also was criticized by victims 
    of authoritarianism---keeping authoritarianism on the agenda. 
4. maybe 4th wave of state-socialist societies in '80's and South Africa in 
   1994
    - here we had political and social integration of former victims and 
    perpetrators
- there are a couple different ways authoritarian systems can fall, most actual
cases are a mix of these types
1. defeat from outside
    - Germany as example of overthrowing through international intervention
    - rapid development of democratic institutions: import of them,
    denazification, international control
    - few people resisted the Nazis, thus overcoming them was hard, e.g.
    debates over whether May 8, 1945 was a liberation of defeat
2. revolution and resistance from within
    - often 3rd and 4th waves
    - political groups or broad strata rise against authoritarianism
    - end of authoritarianism can become founding narrative of new democracy
    - consolidation challenge: different interests of victims and perps
    - if perps still have power, a power struggle happens
    - sometimes perps will achieve impunity, angering the victims
    - thus the new gov lacks support of powerful groups or the public
3. negotiated chagne
    - often 4th, state-socialist countries
    - transitions negotiated between old regime and protesters, e.g. round
    tables in Poland and Hungary
    - extreme example is SU to RF, protesters played less of a role than
    struggles among the elite
    - advantages in solving/postponing a bunch of possible issues, smooth
    transition, generally high support for transition
    - compromises are always reached on the backs of the ones most hit by the
    regime, that's dysfunctional for democratic consolidation, these groups
    tend to be excluded
- international context matters, outside influence can be decisive, cultural
frame of reference
- international impact felled European and Japanese authoritarian regimes
- international pressure from the UN, EU, EC influence South Africa and
ex-Yugoslavian countries, and also failed transitions in Afghanistan and Iraq
- some strategies become globally diffused as best-practices for dealing with
mass atrocities
- international context also matters for memory practices
- since 1990s internationalization of memory
- Holocaust has become a global things that no one should permit to happen;
2002 Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust where 40 countries'
representatives apologized for their countries involvement
- WWII is being framed as European and not just national history; 60th
anniversary of D-Day with many European state leaders; also creates/lays bare
schisms, e.g. Baltic leaders boycotting 2005 Victory Day celebrations because
the reject RF/SU narratives about them being the liberator of Europe

## Transitional Justice: Reckoning with a Macro-Criminal Past

- transition to democracy = return of the legal state
- how to deal with macro-crimes from a legal perspective
- Nuremberg trials: "human rights violations", "crimes against humanity", "war
crimes", got around retroactively applying national laws, but they need to be
recognized
- transitional justice gains clear id of victims and perps through legal
sanctions (punishment, compensation)
- can stand for unbiased coping if formality and political independence are met
- courts can contribute to making reckoning more transparent
- the limit is that these crimes are not individual crimes on a large scale,
but collective crimes---dependent on bystanders' implicit support,
co-responsibility, or profiting from it; e.g. Nazi Germany or South Africa
- Nazi Germany is the main example of macro-crimes with passivity and profiting
- macro-crimes can be hard to pin on individual people, e.g. SU party reps
- the difficulty of pinning guilt on individual people makes judicial reckoning
more difficult
- because law dictates the legal system, it can put an end to
reckoning/persecution of both sides---amnesties and compensation often depend
on laws---and influence the legitimacy of judicial reckoning
- there is a lot of variance in how to deal with the legacy, i.e. Czech
Republic vs. Poland
- judicial reckoning is in no way enough to establish a democratic order
- thus there were Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRCs), came from South
Africa, then implemented in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Peru\dots
- these are supposed to deal with challenges the legal system cannot
address---contradictions between integration and the need to do justice
- South Africa's TRC established and acknowledge the victims' suffering, have
the perps apologize
- by publicly listening and acknowledging their guilt perps could escape
punishment, in the name of promoting national unity
- on the other hand they were criticized for pardoning people and not changing
the political and social situations in any way
- "Thus, although TRCs are set up as a response to the juridical system’s 
incapacity to resolve the social and moral tensions inherited from the
authoritarian political order, they may threaten to annul the merits of a
juridical ascription of individual responsibilities for macro-crimes." (p. 168)

## Collective Memory and Post-Authoritarian Democratic Consolidation

- representation of macro-crimes impacts transition but also democratic culture
- Karl Jaspers (1946) had 4 categories of guilt (on Nazi crimes) that are still
relevant today
    1. if it's individual and judicially dealt with $\rightarrow$ "criminal
       guilt"
    2. committed in the name of pol. collectivity $\rightarrow$ "political
       guilt", responsibility is expected of all members of the collectivity
    3. in reaction to macro-crimes $\rightarrow$ "moral guilt" (kinda shame)
    4. relationship towards instances transcending worldly orders (e.g. God)
       $\rightarrow$ "metaphysical guilt"
- political guilt means responsibility for crimes done on behalf of the
imagined community one ascribes to---being a part equals agreeing to be held
accountable for the actions done on behalf of the group
- moral guilt could be motivation to work against macro-crimes 
- in the years after the atrocities negotiations between the old and the new
can bring stability, e.g. not facing the Nazi past in 50s and 60s Germany gave
stability in a way, then, with stability, they could face the past (young
people accusing their parents of being silent etc)
- democratic consolidation is hindered by a memory of a glorious past if it
cannot be kept in check by the memory of a scornful past, e.g. Russia and the
SU---proud of Great War but ignoring Stalinist atrocities or being reproached
for remembering the Gulag

## The Memory of Macro-Crimes in Late-Modern Democratic Societies

- how to remember macro-crimes questions some assumptions about how symbols
work in democratic societies
- this includes state leaders apologizing for past crimes (Germany, Nazi
collaborators, US president on slavery)
- there were discussions on how to remember such atrocities; museums, school
and education, historiography, public space---apologizing seems to have
established itself as a proven method 
- we observe
    1. most democratic societies are built on some type of massive atrocity,
       e.g. Germany whose constitution is a direct response to Nazi crimes;
       also true for similar histories, like Nazi collaborators or other
       macro-crimes
    2. the is no unchallenged representation of the national past anymore; each
       representation can be seen as excluding certain groups; being silent on
       certain atrocities can be seen as a problem; apologies are a reaction to
       the pluralization of memories
    3. macro-criminal past may be functional for the creation of a national
       narrative, while glorious past narratives would be publicly
       challenged---it's easier to say what you don't want to do than to say
       what you are
    4. cultural trauma: group who was the victim of macro-crimes or group whose 
       members committed those crimes; the former because the passing on of
       traditions got massively interrupted, the latter because their past is
       either distanced from or denied

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Memory and Politics (Erik Meyer)

p. 173

- political science deals with regime change mostly
- thus it is relevant to confront the old regime, it is necessary to come to
terms with the past
- _Vergangenheitsbewältigung_ is still controversial, in Germany is used to
only mean ethical dealing with the Nazi past, now it turned to mean any
abolition of dictatorship and begin of democracy 
- it means the measures used to grapple with the dictatorial past 
- guilt is not only dealt with politically and judicially, but also morally and
metaphysically 

## Transitional Justice and Political Culture

- transitional justice is often explored as historically comparative
- shortly after the fall you have measures like indictment or
compensation---these only matter if they happen during the lifetime of perps
and victims
- these mattes can become involved in foreign policy and diplomacy, thus
Vergangenheitsbewältigung is a precondition to functioning political systems
and international relations 
- Vergangenheitsbewältigung includes everything that is and can be done about
the past
- sanctioning the past gives the option to judge the past
- coming to terms with past history includes all things that touch on the past
- the extent of reckoning with the past is a reflection of the countries
political culture
- conflicts can be conflicts on the interpretation of events
- the narratives and discussions about them reveal structure of power,
interests, norms, values
- this approach is conflict oriented

## Policy for the Past and Politics of History

- in German historiography one has the application of _Vergangenheitspolitik_ and 
_Geschichtspolitik_
- _Vergangenheitspolitik_ is the political process of about 5 years
    - on one hand reintegration of the indicted and convicted Nazis
    - on the other hand creating distance from the remainders of National
    Socialism
- _Vergangenheitspolitik_ defines 3 things (practical political measures)
    1. amnesty
    2. integration
    3. demarcation
- it is dependent on the presence of the involved individuals
- _Geschichtspolitik_ is a broader term
    - deals with the history of a community, which is disputed
    - this is not that interested in the facts of history, but more in the
    connection between past, present, and future
    - it is not about how true the past is, but how it can become politically
    relevant
- _Geschichtspolitik_ is a political thing, it is an instrument of politicians
- it is about how history is used for a political narrative
- it is used to legitimize current political projects, but also influences
normative orientations
- _Geschichtspolitik_ is a mostly discursive practice
- this term was used to describe the politicized use of history in the 1980s by
politicians and historians
- general instrumentalization of history in politics is assumed
- remembrance of the past is impossible without current motifs (after
Halbwachs)
- sites of memory are important in memory and remembrance
- _Geschichtspolitik_ then refers to the political construction of reality
- legitimacy plays a role in _Geschichtspolitik_: legitimacy of identity,
political order, political actors
- legitimacy can be achieved through negative distancing or positive reference
to historical events
- _Vergangenheitsbew&auml;ltigung_: _Vergangenheitspolitik_ zu
_Geschichtspolitik_---from decision to communication

## A Policy Studies Perspective on Cultures of Memory

- memory studies distinguishes communicative and cultural memory
- communicative memory is shaped by the biographical horizon of the
experiencing generation---it can only last if it is institutionalized
- constructing tradition needs decision making, it is not conflict free
- _Erinnerungspolitik_ is a communicative act, but we have to consider
political decisions and resources
- cultures of memory have to be understood as normal political domains
