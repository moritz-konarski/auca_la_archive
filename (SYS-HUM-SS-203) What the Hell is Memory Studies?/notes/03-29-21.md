# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Collective Memory and Cultural History: Problems of Method (Alon Confino)

p. 212

- relationship of power in society shaped by process of remembrance
- memory sustains a relationship of power; "who wants whom to remember what and
why"
- reduction of memory to only politics is weird and doesn't paint the whole
picture
- ignoring the social aspect of memory is not good
- effects of memory on organization, hierarchization, arragements of social and
cultural relationships
- reduction to political makes us intellectually poorer
- mostly people just look at the obvious places where memory is manipulated,
while the places where it is not obvious are the more interesting ones
- we'd miss anything that is not political: association, workplace
- memory studies echos the classic social theory that cultural differences only
reflect social differences -> culture can only be analyzed in connection with
the underlying social preconditions
- this has been abandoned there, and it should also be abandoned in memory
studies
- people describe representation of the past and neglect: transmission,
diffusion, meaning
- reception is important not just for knowledge, but for correct
interpretation of evidence
- reception is measure against evolution of memory, levels of analysis are
separate narratives
- must be more theoretical in the relationship between social, political,
cultural; more anarchical in linking representation and experience
- memory itself is meaningless
- writing the history of memory can be especially useful
- care is needed to do it correctly
- memory of WWII in a country cannot be separated from the evolution of memory
in that country since then
- "To write a history of memory, we need to draw the mental horizon of an age-
When and why did memory become a habit of mind shared by people to give meaning 
to the past? One can imagine that it is the kind of historical problem Warburg 
and Bloch would have been delighted to pose, and perhaps to begin to answer. 
And so, perhaps the first task of the history of memory is to historicize 
memory." (p. 214)
