# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Mass Atrocity, Collective Memory, and the Law (Mark Osiel)

p. 482

- American legal scholar
- wrote about influence and obligation of law with respect to collective memory
- should law play a big role in collective memory?
- large scale trials capture attention
- can get public attention and stimulate reflection
- thus influence collective memory, maybe even concepts of memory
- "the process of how people are made to vanish has become a distinctive 
feature of postwar conceptions of what memory is."
- highlight official brutality + complicity -> reassessment of beliefs, more so
than most other political events
- "moments of truth"
- moments of transformative opportunity, maybe a goal of the trial
- prosecutors and judges try to shape collective memory as public spectacle but
also as liberal legality
- collective conscience to draw on may not exist at such times
- can still contribute to an underappreciated social solidarity based on
procedures that uphold some kind of due process
- the "poetics" of legal storytelling are important here (how to frame the
Holocaust)
- comparative historical sociology: assess and analyze the tropes employed in
certain trials and their effectiveness; their influence on memory
- defense suggests tragedy, prosecutors a morality play
- judicial task is to have law of evidence, procedure, responsibility, "theater
of ideas"
- trials designed as monumental spectacles to get most impact 
- "liberal show trials" conducted by "moral entrepreneurs" and "activists of
memory"
- this goes beyond a normal task of a court (historical interpretation, moral
pedagogy) and assumes that they can actually influence society meaningfully
- nations have founding myths, either from time immemorial, or from a time of
revolution
- most of these are centered on some type of legal document -> legally induced
- to create such a piece, a bit of smoke and mirrors is necessary;
self-conscious dramaturgy by prosecutors and judges
- e.g. Allies (Nuremberg etc.) tried to make a point about the fair process of
the trial as totalitarianism vs civilized humanity
- dangers: sacrifice rights of defendants to social solidarity; distort
historical understanding; foster delusions of purity through faulty analogies
- they may also fail because they need more extensive admissions of guilt than
most nations are willing to give
- using law to instill shared memories would require large segments of the
population to accept responsibility and break with old beliefs
- also, collective memory arises incidentally, so constructing it
internationally is difficult
- can it only be done dishonestly (not disclosing its deliberate creation)?
- assertion of rights or stigmatization of the violation can be focal point for
a nation's memory -> rites of commemoration
- shared memories are consolidated; typical problem with "real" and "false"
memories
- to prevent mass atrocities, a shared and enduring memory of them needs to
exits; the law can be employed to get there

- stuff about how memory is being created and used
- now we get to the discussion of Mark Osiel's text

## Mass Atrocity, Collective Memory, and the Law (Mark Osiel)

- what is the purpose of the major war crime trials
- "how people are made to vanish" -> forced disappearances, abductions,
extrajudicial killings
- narratives are considered to be cathartic
- does catharsis do any justice to anyone? catharsis -> purification and 
purgation of emotions
- Eichmann's trial is a big example of show trials: summoned over 100 witnesses
even though archival information would have easily sufficed for a conviction;
the defense refused to have their witnesses (that would have attested immoral
behavior of Jews) speak
- remembrance narratives never leave space for remembering deserters either
- court's influence should be dependent on how much stock people put in courts
and the legal system
