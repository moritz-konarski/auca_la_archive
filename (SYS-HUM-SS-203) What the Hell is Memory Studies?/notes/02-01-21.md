Remembering to forget---how can one do that?

Remembering to forget sounds like some type of oxymoron. How can one remember
not to remember? This does pose some interesting questions. Because it seems
impossible to remember not to remember, can forgetting to forget get us
anywhere? I think in many cases that's how forgetting works---we simply
forget---about remembering and forgetting. Does that mean that forgetting to
forget makes one forget?

One way to understand this phrase could be that remembering is
necessary for forgetting. This seems obviously true because if one does not
remember anything there is nothing to forget. On the other hand, if one wants
to remember new things one has to forget some things because
human memory is limited and we cannot remember everything. In the text we read 
the author said that forgetting might be more important than remembering 
because it keeps our memory able to store new information. If we didn't forget 
the irrelevant things we would have no space to remember the important ones.

## _Islambek_ Social Forgetting: A Systems-Theory Approach (Elena Esposito)

- remembering to remember is paradoxical
- remembering can be easier than forgetting---remembering is selective and one
can fashion their own picture
- when it comes to forgetting, we need to confront ourselves and the ways we
remember
- Heisenberg's Uncertainty Problem: we cannot _see_ atoms per se, we just have
the Unsch&auml;rferelation beating our asses
- in classic mechanics we either know or don't know---in quantum mechanics we
only have probabilities that we can rely on
- to observe is to change from quantum physics was also being applied to social
sciences
- our brain is a system, the internet is as well
- now talking about Facebook and their targeted ads
- romanticizing history here instead of forgetting about it

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Memory and Forgetting in Paul Ricœur's Theory of the Capable Self (Maureen Junker-Kenny) 
  
p. 203 

- philosophers: exact formulation of specific problems
- analysis and critique of concepts used by other disciplines
- reflection of the things (human beings) other branches presuppose
- what can philosophy offer on memory; personal, collective, cultural
manifestations
- _epistemology_: theory of knowledge
- Ricoeur's analysis has epistemology of history, tracing elements to their
reconstruction
- how can memory influence morality? 
- how to remembering and forgetting interplay?
- two types of forgetting: one destroys traces, the other one leaves them
- active forgetting and ethics of memory depend on a eschatological (theology
concerned with death, judgement, final destiny of the soul) horizon


## Philosophy of the Self as Critical Reflection on Memory and History

- Ricoeur is in dialogue with the philosophical traditions since Plato
- _hermeneutics_: theory of methodology of interpretations, generally of
biblical or philosophical texts
- how can one distinguish memory from imagination, part of philosophies search
for truth
- locating memory in classical philosophical tradition: Plato and Aristotle use
_eikon_ (image)
- Plato: present image of previous imprint
- Aristotle: image/memory as part of time---temporalising vs merely absent
- Plato: _mneme_ and _anamnesis_, involuntary reappearance vs searched-for
recollection
- _phenomenology_: clarify, describe, make sense of structures and dynamics of
pre-reflective human experience
- how can we achieve a faithful representation of past events
- how is reproduction achieved?
- philosophers noted the difference between memory that just resurfaces and
memory that is actively recalled
- we need to establish criteria to categorize memory as true and false
- memory referring to the past raises the question of how to access the past
- how trustworthy are memories? 
- _exegesis_: critical explanation and interpretation of texts, generally 
scripture
- to overcome impasses in the study of memory we must trust individual
testimony
- Adolphi criticized the reclaiming of facts instead of facing the interpretive
nature of history
- the question of "why" in history writing owes its answer to the relevant
facts
- the studied objects are connected with human agents
- history writing has to do justice to history: documenting, being accurate
- Ricoeur keeps between 3 things: a reduction to just facts, ignoring their
potential; supposing we can just reconstruct the past; not judging the past
- he simply states: "we have nothing better than memory"
- Ricoeur insists that there is fact in an event that's not just
interpretation; even if we cannot get past previous interpretations
- this is relevant for trying to refute Holocaust denial because here mere
interpretation of facts would not lead anywhere

## The Ethics of Memory

- memory and levels of ideology are related: integration of a shared world,
legitimization of power, distortion of reality
- national heritage has an ambiguous role in identity construction
- political exploitation of memory and attempts to add credibility to political
systems
- forgiveness is on one level with memory and history
- Ricoeur does not want to turn memory into an imperative: political
instrumentalization, his ethics, short-circuiting the relationship between
memory and history
- he wants "work of memory" and "work of mourning" after Freud
- ethics of memory would fall under the third section of applied ethics or
"practical wisdom"
- each case of memory has to be decided individually
- he criticizes amnesty as commanded forgetting for the sake of the stability
of the state
- goal is a pacified, happy memory
- can happen as result of a reconciliation, a forgetting that preserves
- forgiveness is not a natural part of human capability
- love stronger than death endures, similarly we have to trust that forgiveness
will be there
- can forgiveness only be realized with respect to the future?
- forgiveness recognizes the crimes and the rift between perps and victims
- a person is more than the sum of their acts
- she really loves Ricoeur, calls him a true master
