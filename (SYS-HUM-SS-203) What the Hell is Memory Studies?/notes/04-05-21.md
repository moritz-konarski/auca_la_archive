- who is Marx talking about when he says "They are therefore incapable of
asserting their class interest in their own name, whether through a parliament
or a convention. They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented.
Their representative must at the same time appear as their master, as an
authority over them, an unlimited governmental power which protects them from
the other classes and sends them rain and sunshine from above."?
- the proletarians need to have representatives such that they are their
masters but also

## _Meerim_ Karl Marx

- for revolutions people always borrow stuff from previous revolutions to give
their current revolution credibility
- she is reading off and it's horrible
- opinion on "In like manner the beginner who has learnt a new language always
translates it back into his mother tongue, but he has assimilated the spirit of
the new language and can produce freely in it only when he moves in it without
remembering the old and forgets in it his ancestral tongue." (p. 89)
- she is not making sense, just repeating Marx and doing so badly
- opinion: "The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare

- his idea of old revolutions being used to support current movements is in
line with this idea
- understanding language can help us understand stuff
- reflexivity, influence of a person on thinking and remembering
- in Spanish, to exile can be an active verb, in most languages you can say
something like that
- languages can tell us stuff about perceptions in particular cultures

a nation-based economy, while today we have a more international economy
- something can move us from Marx to Gadamer
- what do we think when we say representation

## _Symbat_ Gadamer

- what does one need to know about memory to understand hermeneutics
- tradition is an ongoing process of interpretation

- can there be a way of experiencing the world that is not scientific
- "For so long as our mind is influenced by a prejudice, we do not know and

in order to see past the accompanying prejudice
