# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (Jan Assmann)

p. 223

- mneno-history: don't ascertain truth of traditions, but study them as
traditions of collective memory
- communicative memory: past handed down between generations in everyday
conversation, limited time, malleable, changing; lacks cultural characteristics
- cultural memory: accumulated residue of distant pasts, source of awareness of
unity and peculiarity
- mnemo-history: not past, but with how it is remembered
- mh concerned with recourse of the past, only appears in later readings
- truth of memory does not lie in factuality, but actuality
- living on is caused by continued relevance; comes not from the past, but from
the present where they are remembered as important
- mh analyzes importance the present gives the past; analyzing the mythical
elements in tradition and uncovering their hidden agenda
- history -> myth as soon as it is remembered, narrated, used
- study of history != study of its commemoration, tradition, transformation in
collective memory
- memory is reconstructive imagination; not stored but processed
- truth of memory lies in the identity that is shapes
- we are the stories that we are able to tell about ourselves
- each of us lives a narrative, we all collectively do too
- myths: stories that a society or group lives by; important for ethnogenesis
- history is imbued with narratives of its own
- greeks saw culture as a form of memory
- discourse: series of texts on the same subject and on each other; textual
debate
- discourse has a life of it's own and is kind of self-reproducing

# _Notes_ Collective Memory Reader: Collective Memory and Cultural Identity (Jan Assmann)

p. 226

- person's belonging to a group is not phylogenetic, but a result of
socialization and customs
- survival of the type is a function of cultural memory
- self-images and memories are specific to social groups
- communicative memory is temporally close, cultural memory is temporally
distant
- cm does not have a temporal horizon
- memory cannot preserve the past, it only holds that which it can reconstruct
in its contemporary frames of reference
- memory needs to be crystallized to be institutionalized
- there is a system of values and structure to memories and symbols
- reflexivity: 
    1. practice-reflexive: interpreting common practice through proverbs and
       ritual
    2. self-reflexive: uses itself to modify itself
    3. reflexive of its own image; reflects the self-image of the group
- cultural memory: body of work cultivated to stabilize and convey a self-image

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Reader: Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and the Making of Israeli National Tradition (Yael Zerubavel)

p. 251

- deployment of memory in construction of Israeli nationhood; national
mythologies in general
- "master commemorative narratives": underwrite generation of particular
settings; master narratives in defining turning points
- commemoration reproduces a commemorative narrative; provides a moral message
- cm draws on historical sources, but selectively and creatively
- undergoes narrativization
- creativity of commemorative narrative within historical narrative is
interesting
- comm is fragmentary in nature
- in combination, they contribute to master commemorative narrative which
structures collective memory
- provides group members with a notion of a shared past
- study of an event involves study of its commemoration and of the
commemoration of related events
- mcn focuses on group's distinct social identity; highlights historical
development; also to formation of a nation
- generally group moving through history; mostly linear time, sometimes
suspended for certain reasons
- holidays etc disrupt the normal flow of time to give attention to important
events
- historical patterns recur within a group
- mcn marks events that set a group apart
- beginnings, divides, and others are used to demarcate "us" from "them"
- use of birth vs origin as separation from another group and also coming into
own life
- mcn imposes order on the past
- reconstructs past from a current ideological stance
- past is divided into major stages, basic plot of structures
- power lies in establishing basic images of particular ideological stances
- drastic definitions make advancements and setbacks clear; give development
structure
- commemorative density: importance attached to different areas of the past
- collective amnesia: not commemorating entire periods
- historical time -> commemorative time
- collective memory takes specific events and makes them into decisive moments;
turning points
- which points to select highlights the ideological underpinnings
- events can turn into political myths through which people perceive current
events
- analyzing different commemorations of the same event can give insight into
the tension and mediation involved
- if the myth can no longer mediate the tension surrounding an event, it
becomes openly contested
- __countermemory as something that opposes the mcn__
- mcn is political elites construction of the past, cm is of the marginalized
groups of society and opposed to mcn
- even cm targeting only one event is highly subversive to mcn, as it questions
its validity
- collective memory is thus contested and changeable
- with enough force, cm can become mcn

## _Galina_ Jan Assmann's texts from our readings

- developed theory by Halbwachs, collective memory analyzed from historical
perspective
- talking about mnemo-history: analyze the mythical elements in tradition and
discover the hidden goals
- 6 main characteristics of cultural memory
- just nothing of her own work, she is simply reading shit aloud
- truth and facts don't really have intrinsic meaning, we have to form
a narrative about it to make sense
- example of the storming of the Capitol in the US
- likening OCD to origin myths? obsessive compulsive thinking has "magic
thinking" behind it, if you repeat it enough times, it becomes more sure; you
convince yourself that doing certain things will avert disaster
- taking charge of a part of something means taking control of the whole
- you can influence the rest of the universe by influencing a small part of it
- how can magic thinking be applied to cultural terms? Superstitions are a good
example
- magic thinking is an important part in myth making (in the anthropological
and psychological sense)
- we tell this story about ourselves, they help us understand the creation of
narratives too
- myths should be incorporated into narrative analysis because to normal
people, they are as real as actual facts
- pay attention to the predecessors: Warburg, Halbwachs
- Assmann is the founding father of memory studies
- loss during transmission from communicative memory to cultural memory
