From _Reflections on the Revolution in France_

- purpose of revolution: preserve ancient laws and liberties; ancient
constitution of government is only guarantee for law and liberty
- to find the roots of this, look at history and acts of parliament
- don't look at religion or revolutionary ideas
- fabricating new government fills him with horror and disgust
- he wishes to get all things they have as inheritance from their forefathers
- they preserved the inheritance by not adding something against its nature
(scion from horticulture: new part grafted onto the roots stock)
- any reforms should have reverence to antiquity
- he hopes that all later reformations will also have this spirit
- considering inheritance is good
- freedom leads to misrule and excess, but if a canon of the forefathers is
there, this can be tempered
- descent inspires with a native dignity; prevents upstarts from being insolent
- liberty -> noble freedom; pedigree of noble ancestors
- we can look back at the symbols and products of earlier times
- we treat it like we treat reverence in nature: by age and by whom it is
descended
- sophister - philosopher?
- choosing nature and hearts rather than speculation and invention for rights
etc
- directly addressing the people in France:
    - they should have followed the example of britian?
    - give some dignity to the freedom that they regained
    - they had not lost their original dignity during oppressive rule
    - some of it was destroyed but all the foundations and some of the walls
    were still there--they could have been built on
    - their constitution was not finished, but it could have been revised and
    perfected
    - the old constitution had all the action and counteraction that ultimately
    lead to harmony
    - these oppositions were considered to great for the new constitution, but
    they bring a check to all proceedings
    - they make deliberation necessary and not just a choice
    - they necessitate compromise which means moderation; thus they prevent
    harsh, crude, unqualified reformations
    - arbitrary power can thus not be exerted by anyone
    - everything was ordered and in its place
    - proper monarchy could have weighed them all down and made sure they
    stayed where they belonged
    - they had all these advantages, but chose to pretend that they did not and
    to start over from scratch
    - they began by despising all that they had, and thus they made a mistake
    - if the last generations were not good, why not leave them and start
    before it went bad
    - in them you could have seen a standard of virtue and wisdom that's worth
    using
    - this would have elevated you
    - respecting ones forefathers would teach to respect oneself
    - they chose to represent the French as people of yesterday, low-born
    wretches until the _emancipation of 1789_
    - analogous to a group of _maroon slaves_ that was suddenly freed from
    bondage, and thus not to be held accountable for the abuse of liberty
    because they were not used to it
    - instead of this he advocates for: seeing themselves as he sees them:
    a generous and gallant nation that was long misled by its high values of
    fidelity, honour, loyalty
    - unfavorable events made them slaves, but not a servile disposition, but
    a public spirit, worshiping their country through the person of their king
    - he would have liked them acknowledge their error compared to their
    ancestors and go back to their principles and preserve recent honor and
    loyalty
    - if they didn't want their own shit, they could have gone back to what
    countries around them kept alive of their old European traditions and
    adapted them to the current day
    - that would have been wise
    - this would have been worthy of veneration
    - they would have shamed despotism
    - well disciplined freedom is auxiliary to law
    - you would have had:
        - productive revenue
        - flourishing commerce
        - free constitution
        - potent monarchy
        - disciplined army
        - reformed and venerated clergy
        - mitigated but spirited nobility
        - liberal order of commons to emulate and select the nobles
        - protected, satisfied, laborious, obedient people
    - virtue leads to happiness in all conditions
    - this is the true moral equality of mankind
    - monstrous fiction (the three ideals) inspires false ideas and vain expectations into men
    - civil classes are established as much for the benefit of the humble as
    for the more splendid (but not more happy)
    - you had a chance for true luck and glory unlike any in the history of the
    world, but you threw it away
