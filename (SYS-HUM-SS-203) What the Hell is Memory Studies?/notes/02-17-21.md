# _Class_ 17.02.2021

## Introduction

- Hatice (Hati-_je_) is the name we should remember
- she writes on literary representations of the memory of the Spanish civil war
and Irish Troubles in literature
- she generally teaches on literature, has also taught Spanish for some time
- she's amazed that students here speak so many languages because this can be
useful for discussion on how remembering works (like different words used for
the same thing in different languages)
- she will continue the course in the way Forsberg did
- Forsberg will be kept up to date and be involved in grading our stuff

## Text discussion

- we create memories by creating narratives
- write something quick about the narrative created by the website and ted talk
- TED is like a failure conference, most people there are not afraid to fail
- you have to dare to do anything, and if you fail doing it, you still tried
- some people misunderstand common English expressions
- we are now doing the presentation on our text

## Free writing

What can you say about the self-remembering on <https://brenebrown.com/about/>?

A funny element that struck me is that she identifies herself not as American,
but as Texan and that she wears cowboy boots in the photo next to her short
bio. The bio also gives the official rundown of who she is, it's the usual
thing you would expect.

Her pictures show the most important milestones in her life, it seems to be
pretty similar to what most people would do. Nothing about the things she
highlights strikes me as particularly unusual (besides that she is probably 
more successful than most people).

In connection to her focus on vulnerability and courage I would say that
showing her life story for all to see takes a certain amount of courage and
makes her a little vulnerable. But connected to her stated motto of "I believe 
that you have to walk through vulnerability to get to courage, therefore 
$\dots$ embrace the suck" is not really reflected in her life story. I don't
really see any "suck"; the memories she presents are memories of happiness and
success. The life she presents seems perfect and ideal. There is a possibility
that she has not had any "suck" in her life, but I doubt that.

I could imagine that she is doing this deliberately, as her page title says 
"Owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest 
thing that we will ever do". She might be "owning her story" and loving herself
through it; this would explain why the life she presents is so perfect.

I feel like that this narrative she presents is disingenuous when combined with 
her message of having to overcome vulnerability because to me her photos do not
reflect any real amount of vulnerability. Her photos do not reflect any real
shame or vulnerability, she creates a success story.

## _Zarena_ Psychology, Narrative, and Cultural Memory: Past and Present (Jürgen Straub)

- things that happen to a person shape their personality and might keep them
from making the same mistakes more than once
- engagement with the past and history
- the personality of a person is the representation of their past
- _memory is a narrative that is constructed retroactively_, can we trust any
memories
- also talking about creating false memories which seem real and cannot be
distinguished from 
- __main point of the text is that memories are constructed narratives that are
not reliable; we create a narrative full of meaning and sense; they are
influenced by one's culture, society, psychology__
- in connection with the website we looked at we see this very clearly
- we create memories according to social and psychological expectations as well
- we understand our experiences in-line with common narratives
- should be appreciate all that happened because it shaped us?

# _Notes_ Cultural Memory Studies: Against the Concept of Cultural Trauma (Wulf Kansteiner and Harald Weilnböck)

p. 229

- academic handbooks impart important knowledge and concepts from one
generation to the next--this is not that
- they see the approaches to developing an interdisciplinary concept of
cultural trauma as spectacular failures
- they blame their colleagues for wrongly applied post-structuralist theory and
developing a narrow and aestheticized concept of trauma
- they hope this will not come across as another boring theory-bash
- they are committed to analyzing master narratives, being reflexive, finding
prejudices, etc
- they object to trauma in current discourse precisely because it is not
reflexive, and because it has an obvious master narrative
- in literature departments trauma studies has contributed to a roll-back of
new procedures
- this trauma stuff has worked against interdisciplinary collaboration in
literary and cultural studies
- _trauma_: "an experience consisting of two components that the trauma victim 
never manages to reconcile with each other. A severe mental and maybe also 
physical injury which the victim seems to overcome remarkably well is followed by 
a belated onset of symptoms that sometimes appear to bear no causal relationship 
to the original injury" (p. 230)
- this is a very compatible definition (with psychology), but she celebrates it
because it gives great insight into the human condition (Caruth)
- this is good because we only get a glimpse at what is truly human when
societal stuff collapses for a bit
- this cannot be transmitted though; it can only be grasped in its
inaccessibility
- trauma is basically impossible to represent
- Caruth celebrates the disconnection between the victim and cultural
institutions, something that their survival might depend on
- she is also not interested in the therapeutic process and misrepresents
psychological literature
- the study of the self-destructive effects of Western culture date back to end
of 19th century, especially strong after WWII
- now though, it has become a convenient and self-important pursuit, see trendy
celebrations of trauma
- Weinberg also believes that trauma is inaccessible; philosophy has the
purpose to make us forget about the bad sides of memory
- he also does not care about the actual trauma victims and not about their
treatment
- he wants to prove trauma's incurability
- they argue that trauma must be inaccessible, and they don't care about trauma
outside of their theoretical studies
- often these discussions take on religious fervor because people care so much
about it
- they all also hold that trauma cannot be represented
- dude from Canada wants all narratives removed because they are often used to
justify excessive violence
- he wants to question "the frames of certitude that ground our understandings
of existence" (186)
- this is also rather doctrinaire because it ignores the good sides of
narrative
- he taps into Holocaust memory to advance his program
- they all ignore the clinical advantages of narrative; not using narratives
might re-traumatize people
- people don't differentiate between trauma as a concept and the trauma that
people actually experienced
- can we ask 9/11 survivors to risk their mental health because some scholar
disagrees with the metaphorical meaning of trauma?
- people bash trauma in media while it might actually be a good thing to raise
awareness
- some scholars conflate the challenges we all face with severe trauma
- most people never experience PTS, and thus there needs to be a difference
between the different experiences
- they have 5 main criticism:
    - a very vague concept of what trauma is; connecting physical trauma and
    metaphorical concepts; ignoring the different types of trauma and how it
    affects people
    - no interest in having interdisciplinary research, i.e. ignoring
    psychology
    - they ignore the research on media influence on people
    - unfounded fear of the narrative, contradicting psychotherapy
    - putting stuff on too-high a pedestal
- apparently these scholars are bystanders who want to philosophize about
trauma that they have to personal experience with
- they want to remove the actual experience by speculation
