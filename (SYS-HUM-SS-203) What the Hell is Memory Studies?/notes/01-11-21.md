# _Class_ 11.01.2021

## Introduction to the Course

- class is difficult
- the readings are not long, but difficult even for native speakers
- he discovered this subject by accident
- Clyde Forsberg is our professor
- if there is one thing you should learn at university, what is it?---we
learn how to learn
- Forsberg did not graduate from high school
- he studied a bunch of different things, first two degrees were in Religious
studies, can read and write Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic
- got a graduate degree in education and realized he hadn't missed anything in
high school
- PhD in European, American, and Canadian history
- at 40 he figured out what he is learning for, it took him until after he
finished his PhD
- he remembers Reagan not because he was in DC and saw it go down, but because
he saw how Reaganomics destroyed people's lives and homes in Canada
- we will talk about digital memory and the problems that come with it
- the course will be artsy-fartsy, but it will also have a practical side to it
- 3-4 decent essays over the course of the semester
- the first thing we will have to do is watch a movie---they tend to be dark
and he loves that (Danish and Canadian are apparently the best)
- he hates the lovy-dovy Hollywood movies
- __watch the movie _Remember___
    - it is about a German senior citizen living in Canada, in an elder home
    - he has Alzheimer's disease as he is in his 70s
    - he was in Germany during WWII
    - story is fictitious, but the war hero attempts to track down a Nazi
    commander that he believes killed his entire family
    - this is our first assignment, we will talk about it in class
- the Holocaust is one of the main items of memory studies
- trauma fucks with your head, so it is hard to say if you actually remember or
not
- this means that one often gets it wrong---when something happened, how it
happened, etc
- memory studies focuses on why you remember things the way you did, and why
you cannot really trust your memory
- how can one do history if one's own memory is not even trustworthy
- a couple hundred years ago Canadians did what Trump supporters did a couple
days ago
- Canadian health care is better than US health care---you don't have to pay
a dime for your treatment
- free writing is a good thing, even though writing is different than shooting
shit over some beers
- basically we are just at university to learn how to put things into your own
words
- this course has a bunch of difficult conceptual things and boiling them down
into simple, straight-forward words
- we aren't really here to learn about memory studies, we will use memory
studies to learn how to write
- Forsberg had a 57% in his high school history class, meaning it is not bad to
not get it at first
- his parents were super hardcore religious, and he only found out how fucked
it was until he left and saw what else there was
- he is the oldest one of 14 siblings
- if one is studying---writing is a good way to do it
- free writing, 10 minutes
- why do men tend to forget anniversaries, and why do women seem to remember
them better? Nobody knows how
- if you don't delete files (forget things), maybe your system gets gummed up
and slower if one does not de-clutter 
- two kinds of forgetting---forget what a person did (my father was so nice and
kind when he certainly wasn't) or the kind of forgetting where you can let
things go without erasing the things that happened
- is the idea of psychotherapy to remember? you need to remember and work
through it so that you can finally forget
- remembering what you need to remember is an important part of learning and
remembrance

## Free writing

Which is better: To remember or to forget? Take a position.    

It is better to forget than to remember. Forgetting can enable one to 
experience the same thing anew more than once. It can
also mean that unpleasant things can be forgotten. If that happens, it can 
almost seem like they never happened. In some cases this might benefit the 
person who forgets. Forgetting can help to de-clutter our
brain and get rid of information we do not need. If I remembered everything
that I heard and did even in just one day my brain would be too full to be 
useful. I do not need to remember what exactly I had for breakfast, or which 
pants I wore last week. Forgetting can make room for the important things that
should be remembered. Today I feel like this is even more true than 50 years
ago because so much information is at our disposal whenever we want. We do not
need to remember facts that a computer can tell us. We all carry one on us most
of the time and can retrieve information in seconds. In some way this makes
remembering, especially remembering of facts, useless. Maybe we even waste 
energy and brain capacity when we try to remember things that we do not need 
to remember. If we focused on forgetting everything we do not need or can
simply look up again, we'd have more space and capacity to remember the things
we cannot simply look up---personal experiences, emotions, etc.

- there he buys a Glock 17 9mm handgun
- he has to find a man named Rudi Kurlander and kill him, one of the 4 is
it---his real name is Otto Wallisch
- the first Rudi he finds was in the Wehrmacht, but at 18 he was in North
Africa with General Rommel, and he has proof of that
- he is still proud of his military service, and even agreed with Hitler on the
work camp stuff, but not on extermination camps
- but because he is not the one, Zev goes to Canada in search of another Rudi
- this one turns out to be a Jew as well, he even was at Auschwitz
- in that nursing home he plays piano for the first time since his wife's death
and he remembers how to do it
- then he travels to Idaho to the house of the 3rd Rudi
- this one died and his son, a State Trooper, takes Zev in
- he shows him his dad's memorabilia collection:
    - Nazi flag that flew over Berlin during Kristallnacht (09.11.1938)
    - original Star of David patch
    - first edition Mein Kampf
    - framed picture of Heinrich Himmler
    - full SS uniform
- dad was a proud Nazi, would hang out with friends and tell stories
- they start drinking and it turns out that his dad only was a cook in the army
- John finds out Zev is Jewish and freaks out, shouting Heil Hitler in his face
- then he sets their German shepherd Eva on Zev, who shoots and kills both the
dog and John
- en-route to his next stop he has a fit of dementia and walks into a road,
trips and goes to the hospital
- there, he has a young girl read his letter to him
- Max used to be a Nazi hunter with the Simon Wiesenthal Center and caught many
Nazi war criminals---now he is incapable so he sends Zev
- Zev had promised Max and his late wife Ruth he'd kill Otto Wallisch
- he leaves the hospital and goes to the 4th Rudi
- his daughter welcomes him
- when Rudi joins them, he and Zev recognize and remember each other
- they go outside to talk in private
- Rudi said he'd go outside from time to time to speak his name and remind
himself of who he was/is
- Zev wants him to admit who he really is, at gun point, then threatening the
granddaughter
- Rudi's family finds them outside and Charles joins them as he finally finds
Zev
- despite Rudi's pleading, Zev makes him admit what he did, being
a Blockf&uuml;hrer and killing many people
- then he reveals that he was Kunibert Sturm, and that Zev was Otto Wallisch,
both Blockf&uuml;hrer at Auschwitz
- they both took fake names and escaped, tattooing themselves numbers on their
left arms
- in rage, Otto shoots and kills Kunibert, says "I remember", and commits
suicide
- finally we find out that Max knew all along and set Otto up, he is satisfied
with finally having killed his families murderers
- his justification for murder was that he, Otto, and Kunibert were too old to
be properly extradited to Germany and then convicted, that would take too long
and they would die in the meantime
