=============================================

Notes
-----

-   tiger image and "like god above"
-   a bunch of Czar boot-licking
-   Manas made the guy that God's own lips called "Son" submit
-   Almambet will become companions with a Sultan of the Nogay
-   Manas again fights all but the Padisha
-   the czar tells him the exact stuff the poet has been saying the
    whole time, repeating all that stuff ad nauseam
-   live a good life and God will reward you, says the totally muslim
    czar
-   he was made powerful by God, he spreads his crecend borws, haha
    symbolism (he showed clemency??)
-   the czar really likes Manas and talks like a nomad
-   Jakip rides out to find a good bride for Manas
-   he has a formulaec exchange with a shepherd about how Manas provides
    for him
-   Whitebeard as an alias of the czar
-   the shepard slaughters his best sheep in Jakip's honor
-   he then tells him about Kanikey and the whole family situation
-   crescent-moon-jeweled horse of Jakip-bay -&gt; symblism
-   Jakip found no beauty anywhere else, so now he is here
-   Kalmak are so infidel that they tie pig's legs to their horses
-   Manas is blessed by God
-   Mendi-bay is outraged that Jakip shows up empty-handed asking for
    Kanikey
-   he wants Jakip beaten for this insult
-   Manas is so mighty that the khan fears him, he could destroy all the
    great heroes around
-   he bades his warriors treat Jakip with utmost respect, the next day
    they shall talk and see
-   Jakip is pretty explicit about Kanikey's beauty
-   Temir answers that Manas is known to be a quarrelsome fellow, while
    Kanikey is comically pure, to the point of ridiculousness
-   if Manas stops his break-neck lifestyle, he will get his daughter,
    otherwise not as Temir does not want to see her grieve
-   Jakip is not amuse, threatens that Manas will take her by forces
    anyways, the czar gave him all people (except russians) and he will
    destroy you
-   Temir is frightened and claims to have made a joke, goes and
    consults his wife, daughter and seniors
-   Mendi-bay complains about the non-existant gifts, then claims he'd
    kill Manas
-   the entaurage tells him to shut up, they are afraid of Manas
-   a random boar image appears
-   they get Jakip and treat him like a khan
-   now they suggest and offer Jakip should bring
-   Manas is again compared to God, he prepares the gift for Temir
-   Manas first goes and counsels with the czar, who approves
-   the czar uses the same kind of left/right seating as a yurt would
    have
-   he give Manas coin to give a gifts to the in-laws
-   Manas swears by God
-   Mendi-bay tries to start a war with Manas and Temir khan
-   Manas is left outside while the 40 companions are invited into a
    yurt
-   Manas laments being an only-child, no brothers to look after him
-   the companions realize their error and gallop back in disarray and
    fear, Manas might kill them for what they did
-   Manas basically bribes the kinswomen of Kanikey
-   he goes to Kanikey's yurt, being the first man to ever be there
-   he ate her food, drank her kumys, undoes her buttons (80) and slips
    into her bed
-   Kanikey is a virgin, it is signaled all over
-   Manas proceeds to rape the sleeping Kanikey
-   Kanikey sits up and draws her dagger, proceeding to ask him who he
    is
-   Manas says he brought the gifts, so he is no stranger here
-   she humiliates him, not recognizing who he is
-   he insults her back, calling her spoilt etc
-   she then slashes his forearm and calves
-   he threatens to harm her, making her a shepard or something, for
    that he will go raiding to get the herds for that
-   Manas calls her a shrew, her mother also calls her spoilt
-   Kanikey interrupts them and tells them she wants to find out what
    kind of man
-   the yurt of Manas is floating??
-   Manas vows to fight his father?
-   the companions attack Temir khan and Jakip khan
-   now Temir khan's people want to go and hand over Kanikey to make the
    fighting stop
-   K is noble, so she will not be troubled by the Companions, she will
    do it herself
-   Manas sees the maidens and plans to seize them as booty to punish
    Kanikey
-   he wants to put her on the horse without a saddle
-   Manas asks her if she has come to her senses?
-   there are shapeshifting maidens in this **not very muslim**
-   Almambet is the best of the companions, he would be worth while
    Altinay
-   Atinay should try to get Almambet
-   Mendi-bay wants to not give maidens to Manas and wants to kill him
    for what he did
-   Mendi-bay does listen to Temir khan, but only if he is threatened
