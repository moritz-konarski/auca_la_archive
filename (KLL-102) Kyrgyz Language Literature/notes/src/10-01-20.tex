\section{Birth of Manas -- Elmira Köçümkulkïzï}

\subsection{Notes on the text}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Jakip's wife Chiyirdi is pregnant
    \item he kills 80 mares for her but that's not enough
    \item she craves tiger meat but Jakip can't find it
    \item she insists like crazy -- finally Jakip goes and searches for a tiger
    \item all the 40 families come together to search for the tiger, getting
        their best hunters to look for one
    \item they collect 90 camel loads of wheat and buy some from a Kitay hunter
        called Kochku
    \item they celebrated by sacrificing animals -- now the boy to be born will
        be strong as a tiger
    \item Baabedin? 
    \item Jakip heeds his people to not let the Manchu know because they would
        raise his land and capture his wife
    \item he also mentions other enemies that would also kill this promising
        ruler
    \item Akbalta makes the Kyrgyz swear by eating white wheat bread and
        touching The Koran to not spread the secret
    \item traitors will be disowned and killed
    \item Jakip always wanted a son but all he had was livestock
    \item now he might not be able to bear it to get one
    \item if it's a girl, kill one horse and feast, don't tell him about it
    \item if it's a boy, kill 90 animals and feast, let a Mullah proclaim that
        he is \textbf{Manas} and ride to him immediately
    \item Jakip falls asleep and a white bearded man sent by God comes to him,
        telling him that he got a son and should go to him
    \item he prophecies that Manas will be a great warrior, learn to write at
        7 from a caliph, be blessed by a prince of faith, greet 12 masters, and
        guided by 40 guardians
    \item 3740
\end{itemize}
