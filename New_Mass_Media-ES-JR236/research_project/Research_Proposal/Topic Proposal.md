# Encryption in Digital Media

- __open data and data visualization__
- __what kind of data is available for visualization??__
- __find data on encryption__
- hark back to the CGP Grey video on encryption for some nice points
- __What is an interesting topic??__
- encryption is vital to modern digital (mass) media
- because the internet is open, data needs to be encrypted
- nobody would use email if someone could easily read what they are writing
- no online commerce/banking would be possible without proper encryption of
  transactions
- no accounts could be created if passwords and data were not protected by
  encryption
- encryption was used in earlier forms of media, like telephone calls and
  ciphers in letter etc.
- those forms of media had another level of security: the physical one
- the internet takes that away by connecting everyone to everyone else
- nobody needs to intercept the letter in transit or be in a specific area to
  record a phonecall, everyone can come to your digital door whenever they like

# Privacy for the 21st century

- public key cryptography was a great jump forward, allowing users to
  communicate, even if there was no secure channel
- the debate boils down to whether one wants civil liberties or 'better' rule
  of law

__how the dabate on encryption is going in the EU, how the dumb-fuck LEA's
whine about going dark and using reports about cyber crime to have some data on
what kind of criminal stuff is happening online__

__cyber crime and the problem that to fight it LEA's want to regulate
encryption, which makes the whole system weaker. At the same time encryption
protects users from crime in the first place__
