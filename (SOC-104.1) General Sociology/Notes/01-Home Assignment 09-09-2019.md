# What is Sociology?

## Notes

### Introduction

- Sociology is the study of human social life, it has many sub-sections, ranging from the
  analysis of conversations to the development of theories to try to understand how
  the entire world works.
- society changes over time, sociology is rooted in significant societal changes, it was an
  attempt to understand these changes
- some early sociologists include Marx, Weber and Durkheim
- they employed _sociological imagination_: the ability to situate personal troubles
  within an informed framework of social issues (after C. Wright Mills)
- Sociological imagination enables understanding larger historical schemes in terms of their 
  meaning for the inner and outer life of individuals
- Wright Mills said people need to be able to use information and reason to understand the world
  and themselves
- stepping outside of their personal worldview and seeing what influences behavior,
  attitudes and culture
- sociological imagination is more than common sense, it's based on science, not feelings
- sociological theories are tested and proven/disproves using scientific methods
- Sociology == putting social events into their environment and trying to understand
  social phenomena by collecting and analysing empirical data

### History

- it emerged in the early 19th century in response to modernity
- more cultural exposure, breakdown of traditional norms and customs -> nuanced
  understanding of the world was needed
- Sociology tries to understand the how and why of this development
- Sociology was coined by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) in 1838, meaning study of
  companion(ship)
- he argued for The Law of Three Stages:
    - theological stage: religious view of society
    - metaphysical stage: society understood as natural
    - positivist stage: pinnacle of social development, society is governed by reliable
      knowledge and is understood through science, primarily sociology
- other classical theorists are Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Ferdinand Toennies, Emile
  Durkheim, Vilfredo Pareto, Max Weber
- most of them were not trained Sociologists, but historians, philosophers, economists,
  thus they researched a variety of topics, but most only left impressions on Sociology
- in the 1890s, the first books and university courses on Sociology started appearing in
  the USA and Europe, later in the 1920s some appeared in Germany and Poland
- during this time, multiple international Associations of Sociologists were founded
- because many early sociologists were from other sciences, they stressed the importance
  of the scientific method and employed similar methods to natural sciences. This set
  Sociology apart from theology, philosophy and metaphysics
- this lead to it being accepted as an empirical science
- later Weber developed a concept of Verstehen (understanding), which is more subjective
- today there is quantitative sociology (meaning of social phenomena using numbers and
  quantities) and qualitative sociology (understanding social phenomena), and both are
  often used in conjunction with each other
- social science diverges from Humanities in the fact that it emphasizes the scientific
  method or other rigorous standards of research
- with Isaac Newton there was a new concept of what was _science_ and what where
  humanities, such that pressure was put on other disciplines to use mathematical
  relationships to express ideas
- Sociology was one of the first disciplines to embrace this
- statistical research became more common at the beginning of the 20th century
- Freud and James were pioneers in combining scientific inquiry with exploration of human
  relationships
- John Dewey formulated three phases of inquiry:
    - problematic situation with inadequate typical response
    - isolation of data or subject matter
    - reflective, which is tested empirically
- this signaled a development from humanities to social sciences

### Sociology Today

- Sociology holds a niche for the study of social life
- some topics: macro-structures that organize society (race, gender, social class,
  ethnicity, family etc.), social processes that break down macro-structures (deviance,
  crime, divorce), micro-processes (interpersonal interactions, socialization of
  individuals)
- Sociology has historically been a very western discipline

### Questions

1. _What is Sociology?_    
  Sociology is the study of human interaction, social life and the processes that shape
  individuals and societies
2. _Describe the process of professionalization of sociology._    
  Because the first sociologist were trained in other, generally scientific
  disciplines, they put great emphasis on scientific and empirical methods in their
  research, which helped separate sociology from other disciplines of the humanities
  that do not do this. Early sociologists were trying to research the drastic societal
  changes that took place in their time and doing so with scientific methods paved the
  way for sociology to be accepted as a scientific discipline. John Dewey's three
  phases of inquiry describe this process well (see History towards the end)
3. _How is sociology related to other sciences?_   
  When it comes to studying humans and their actions, Psychology looks at it at the
  smallest scale, generally on an individual level. Sociology goes beyond that and
  examines how groups of people behave and what shapes them or how they shape each
  other. Economics looks at how groups of people and other entities handle wealth and
  production, Political Science concerns itself with the study interactions of even larger groups of
  people: communities, cities, states, countries and international organizations. 
  As far as research methods go, Sociology is similar in nature to how Physiscs and
  other natural sciences handle research, a legacy from its early days when most
  Sociologists came from those disciplines.
4. _What do you think of Comte's Law of Stages?_   
  I think that his stages make sense at first glance. Roughly speaking, the first two
  stages fit the conception of history most people have. But of course it is way too
  simplistic to be correct. I know too little about history to refute his first to
  points using facts, but I would say that the third stage is too idealistic to be
  correct in any case. I can not imagine that there will ever be a time when society is
  governed by reliable knowledge and understood only through science. Even today, in
  a time where we are very technologically and scientifically advanced (definitely
  metaphysical stage) society is still i many cases ruled by people's feelings and
  opinions, even though those opinions may be scientifically proven to be incorrect
  (e.g. the existence of climate change, or the (lack of) effectiveness of repressive
  laws and prison systems). Thus I would say that his third stage will probably never
  actually happen. It would be nice, but I do not thin that it is realistic.
5. _What is the scientific stage according to Comte?_   
  The scientific stage is the final stage of societal development, where society is
  governed by scientific knowledge and understood through the lense of science. This
  stage seems utopical, as nice at it could be, I do not believe this stage can become
  reality yet. I am also sceptical of the idea that there can be a world where humans
  put aside their opinions and feelings and only follow science and reason. That seems
  non-human to me. It might also deprive us of empathy and have us at the mercy of
  science, which, as much as we try, might be incorrect. As good as science and the
  scientific method are at finding the truth, they can be wrong or just applied
  incorrectly, even if it's just by accident. Thus I think blindly trusting science is
  never a good idea.
6. _What is the significant trend of sociological research currently?_  
  Recently, sociologists have realized that sociology has historically been a very
  Western science, it generally ignored other regions of the world. This realization
  lead to sociologists focusing on non-Western societies and broadening their research
  to gain a better understanding of them. This goes back to the roots of sociology,
  trying to understand the changes societies got through, and with globalization today
  there may be more change than ever before.

## "Boris Johnson Finds His Party Loyalists Aren't as Loyal as Trump's" - New York Times 08.09.2019

- over the past years Britain and the USA had very similar populist views and strategies,
  but recently there has been a divide
- while Trump has almost no dissenting voices in his party, Johnson was recently blocked
  in his plan to withdraw from the EU even without a deal, he expelled 21 members of his
  own party in response
- this 'rebellion' is threatening his hold of power and might be a lesson to dispirited
  Republicans
- MPs actually spoke out instead of being complicit, like dissenting Republicans 
- the big difference is attributed to the magnitude of the threat of a no-deal Brexit,
  which might be catastrophic
- Republicans do not see Trump as a comparable threat to the US and still largely agree
  with his policies, so they do not rebel on the same level
- Trump has a tight hold of the Republican Party, one that Johnson lacks
- Trump go elected and has his 4 year term safe, while Johnson is much more dependent on
  other parties and people, also he lacks the same kind of grass roots movement Trump has
- maybe if Trump proposed something similarly radical as the UK is facing, Republicans
  would rise against him, but for now they seems content with the way things are going
